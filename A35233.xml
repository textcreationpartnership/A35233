            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE ſeveral dreadful Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes that have happened in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts of the World within a few years paſt, and among others that in the Iſland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and another in <hi>England,</hi> wherein the People of this Nation is particularly concerned, ſeem to call aloud for Repentance and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the horrid Enormities that are boldly committed amongſt us; for the Almighty executes his Judgments upon Mankind that the People of the Earth might learn Righteouſneſs. Therefore the collecting and publiſhing the terrible Relations of Earthquakes, needs no Apology, and may I hope be influential upon the minds of men, who appear affected with the diſmal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that have been lately given of

            <p>I have been the more incouraged to proceed in Printing theſe ſmall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuals by the acceptance that others of this nature have already met with, which, I find, has occaſioned many, (eſpecially young people) to lay aſide thoſe vain and idle Songs and Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wherewith they were formerly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant and to divert their vacant hours with reading the real Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Revolutions and Accidents that are recorded by Authors of the greateſt Veracity, to have happened in divers Ages and Countreys.

            <head>The General HISTORY OF <hi>Earthquakes.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">I. AMong the ſeveral Plagues and Judgments wherewith the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty viſiteth, and puniſheth the Enormities and Sins of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that of Earthquakes may be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt Dreadful and Tremendous, which in an inſtant ſwalloweth up thouſands of people of all Qualities and Ages, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the moſt ſuperb and ſtately Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that Pride and Ambition can raiſe, in a moment, even in the twinkling of an Eye, to convince men of the Greatneſs and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Supream Creator, and how vain it is to value themſelves upon any mundane enjoyments; Of which we have lately had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108503:4"/>very aſtoniſhing Inſtances in ſeveral parts of the World.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But before I proceed to give a Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, it may be neceſſary to diſcover the Natural Cauſes of this dreadful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the Earth, which the God of Heaven makes uſe of to ſignifie his Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for the provoking Crimes of Nation and People; Of which a Learned Divine gives the following account.</p>
            <p n="3">III. An Earthquake is a ſhaking of the Earth, occaſioned by Wind and Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons incloſed within the Caves and Bowels of the Earth, which can find no paſſage, or at leaſt none long enough to diſcharge themſelves, and therefore breaking forth with great force and violence, it ſometimes ſhaketh the Earth, another while rendeth and openeth the ſame, ſometimes caſting up Earth a great height into the Air, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while cauſing the ground to ſink down a great depth, ſwallowing Cities, Towns, Palaces, Caſtles, yea prodigious high Mountains, leaving in the place nothing but deep holes, or long and unfathomable Lakes of Water.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Authors Write differently of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds of Earthquakes, but they uſually comprehend them under four; The firſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108503:4"/>kind is when the Earth is ſhaken laterally or to one ſide, the whole force of the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Wind and Vapours driving to one place, and there is no contrary motion to hinder it. This Wind, if it be not great, cauſeth the Earth to tremble like a man in an Ague Fit, and doth no more harm, but if it be ſtrong and violent, it looſeth the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all Buildings though never ſo firm, overthrows whole Cities, and ſometimes throws down great Hills, ſo that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm all the Valleys under them. The ſecond kind is, when the Earth is lifted up with great violence ſo that the Buildings are like to fall, and inſtantly ſink down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and this is cauſed by the force of the Winds which ſtrive to get upward like Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, and finding ſome deliverance from confinement, the Earth falls down to its former place. The third ſort is the opening rending or gaping of the Earth, which ſinking down ſwallows up Cities, Towns, yea Rocks, Rivers and Flouds, and ſo that they never appear again; Nay the Sea in ſome places hath been drunk up, ſo that People have gone over on foot, till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Tyde hath covered the place with Water again. The laſt kind is, when great Mountains ariſe out of the Earth, or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108503:5"/>elſe when ſome part of the Land ſinketh down, and inſtead thereof ariſe Rivers, Lakes or Fires, breaking out with Smoak and Aſhes; Sometimes the bottom of the Sea is lifted up, whereby many Iſlands are made that were never ſeen before; Of which Hiſtory gives large accounts.</p>
            <p n="5">V. If it be asked how ſuch mighty Winds come to be under the Earth, the Philoſophers anſwer, that the great Caves and Dens of the Earth being always full of Air, when the heat of the Sun reſolves the moiſture of the Earth many Exhalations are generated, both within and without the ſame: and the places being full before, can receive no more, unleſs ſome part be let our, ſo that in thoſe Countries where the Earth hath but few Pores, or where they are ſtopt with moiſture, it muſt neceſſarily happen, that theſe Exhalations ſtriving to get out, muſt needs rend the Earth, or lift it up, either to get free paſſage, or to make room enough to abide within.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. It has been obſerved That there are uſually ſeveral Signs and Preſages of this terrible Calamity. As firſt the raging of the Sea when there are no Tempeſtuous Winds to move it, yea in the greateſt Calm, which is occaſioned by the Winds la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108503:5"/>to get paſſage that way, but being repelled, ſoon after ſhakes the Earth. Again the Water in the bottom of deep Wells is troubled and infected with a Sulphurous ſmell, from the peſtilent Exhalations long incloſed within the Earth, which now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſpread abroad; And hereupon, in divers places an Earthquake has cauſed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Smoak, Flame and Aſhes to iſſue forth, by reaſon that the vaſt quantity of Brimſtone under ground is by the violent motion ſet on Fire and burſteth out, ſo that it is a wonder if after an Earthquake ſome grievous Peſtilence does not follow, the whole Maſs of the Poyſonous Minerals within the Bowels of the Earth being by this furious ſhock blown abroad into the Air. Another preſage is the calmneſs and coldneſs of the Air, by reaſon the Exhalation that ſhould be abroad is within the Earth. Another is ſaid to be, a long thin ſtrake of Cloud ſeen when the Sky is clear after Sun ſet, which, they ſay, is cauſed by the Vapour or Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which is the matter of Clouds, being gone into the Earth. Others affirm that it is the Exhalation which iſſueth from ſome narrow paſſage out of which the reſt of the Wind cannot come, and therefore ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by a ſudden Eruption makes a broader
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108503:6"/>way to deliver it ſelf out of Priſon. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Sun appeareth dim certain days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe the Winds that ſhould purge and diſſipate the groſs Air, which cauſeth this dimneſs, is incloſed within the Bowels of the Earth. Alſo the Birds perceiving a certain trembling and ſhaking at the Roots of the Trees, forſake them, and fit trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling on the ground. Laſtly, there are heard before, at, and after an Earthquake great noiſes and ſounds under the Earth, with terrible groanings and thunderings; Yea ſometimes when no Earthquake follows, the Wind without any other effect finding a way to vent it ſelf; Some of theſe are the general prognoſticks and forewarnings of a dreadful Earthquake to follow.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. And certainly no other Calamity produces greater terror and aſtoniſhment in Mankind than this. For to have the Earth rock under one with that ſingular kind of motion which no humane art nor force can imitate, muſt needs be extream ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; For though death may be familiar to ſome men in any other form, yet it appears very horrible to be buried alive, and to ſink on a ſudden into an unknown Grave they know not whether, perhaps they may fall into ſome dark Lake of Water, or it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108503:6"/>may be drenched in a River of fire, or be daſhed on a Rock; for who can tell the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the Caverns below, or what ſort of the Apartments there are under the Surface of the Earth? We walk on the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements of a marvellous ſtructure, a Globe full of Tremendous ſecrets.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. But though we have given ſome account of the Natural Cauſes of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, yet it is very apparent that many have been ſupernatural, and cauſed by the immediate hand of God, of which we find ſeveral inſtances in holy Scripture, that we might dread and tremble before the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who needs neither Vapours nor Exhalations to Execute his Vengeance upon incorrigible Offenders.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. The firſt of this kind that we read of was at the Promulgation of the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai, Exodus</hi> 19, 20. <q>And the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> go unto the People and Sanctify them to day and to morrow, and be ready againſt the third day, for then the Lord will come down in the ſight of all the People upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and thou ſhalt ſet bounds to the People round about, ſaying, Take heed to your ſelves that ye go not up into the Mount, or touch the border of it, whoſoever touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108503:7"/>the Mount ſhall ſurely be put to death; There ſhall not an hand touch it, but he ſhall ſurely be Stoned or Shot through, whether it be Man or Beaſt, it ſhall not live, when the Trumpet ſoundeth long they ſhall come up to the Mount. And it came to paſs on the third day in the Morning that there were Thunders and Lightnings and a thick Cloud upon the Mount, and the Voice of the Trumpet exceeding loud, ſo that all the People in the Camp trembled. And Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was altogether on a Smoak, becauſe the Lord deſcended upon it in Fire, and the ſmoak thereof aſcended as the ſmoak of a Furnace, and the whole Mount quaked greatly. And all the People ſaw the Thundring and the Lightnings, and the noiſe of the Trumpet, and the Mountain ſmoaking, and when the People ſaw it they removed afar off. And they ſaid unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſpeak thou with us and we will hear, but let not God ſpeak with us leaſt we dye. And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto the People Fear not; for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your Faces that you Sin not.</q> Thie happened in the year from the Creation of the World, 25 13.</p>

            <p n="10">X. Another terrible Earthquake we find recorded <hi>Number</hi> 16. <q>Now <hi>Korah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> with certain of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> two hundred and fifty Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Aſſembly, famous in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, Men of Renown roſe up, and gathered themſelves together againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and againſt <hi>Aaron,</hi> and ſaid unto them, Ye take too much upon you ſeeing all the Congregation is Holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them, wherefore then lift you up your ſelves above the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Lord. And when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> heard it, he fell upon his Face. And he ſpake unto <hi>Korah</hi> and unto all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſaying, Even to Morrow the Lord will ſhew you who are his, and who is holy; and will cauſe him to come near to him, even him whom he hath choſen will he cauſe to come near to him. This do; Take ye Cenſers, <hi>Korah</hi> and all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. And put Fire therein, and put In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe in them before the Lord to Morrow! and it ſhall be that the man whom the Lord doth chuſe, he ſhall be holy, Ye take too much upon you, ye Sons of <hi>Levi;</hi> ſeemeth it a ſmall thing unto you that the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath ſeparated you from the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to bring you near
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108503:8"/>unto himſelf, to do the ſervice of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Lord, and to ſtand before the Congregation to Miniſter unto them? And he hath brought thee near unto him, and all thy Brethren the Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> with thee: and ſeek ye the Prieſt-hood alſo? For which Cauſe both thou and thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany are gathered together againſt the Lord: and what is <hi>Aaron</hi> that ye murmur againſt him? And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſent to call <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> the Sons of <hi>Eliab:</hi> which ſaid, we will not come up. Is it a ſmall thing that thou haſt brought us up out of a land that flouriſheth with Milk and Honey to Kill us in the Wilderneſs, except thou make thy ſelf altogether a Prince over us? Moreover thou haſt not brought us into a Land that floweth with Milk and Honey, or given us Inheritance of Fields and Vineyards; wilt thou put out the Eyes of theſe men? we will not come up. And <hi>Moſes</hi> was very wrath, and ſaid unto the Lord, Reſpect not thou their offering: I have not taken one Aſs from them, neither have I hurt one of them. And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Korah,</hi> Be thou and all thy Company before the Lord, thou, and they, and <hi>Aaron</hi> to Morrow. And take every Man his Cenſer, and put
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108503:8"/>Incenſe in them, and bring ye before the Lord every Man his Cenſer, two hundred and fifty Cenſers; thou alſo, and <hi>Aaron</hi> each of you his Cenſer; and put Fire in in them, and lay Incenſe thereon, and ſtand in the Door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the Glory of the Lord appeared unto all the Congregation. And the Lord ſpake unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and unto <hi>Aaron</hi> ſaying, ſeparate your ſelves from among this Congregation that I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them in a moment, And they fell upon their faces and ſaid, O God, the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh, ſhall one Man ſin, and wilt thou be wrath with all the Congregation? And the Lord ſpake unto <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaying, ſpeak unto all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ſaying, Get you up from about the Tabernacle of <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> roſe up, and went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram;</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> followed him. And the ſpake unto all the Congregation ſaying, Depart I pray you from the Tents of theſe Wicked Men, and touch nothing of theirs leaſt you be conſumed in all their Sins. So they gat them up from the Tabernacle of <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> on every ſide: and <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> came out, and ſtood
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108503:9"/>in the Door of their Tents, and their Wives, and their Sons, and their little Children. And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, Hereby ſhall ye know that the Lord hath ſent me to do all theſe works: for I have not done them of my own mind. If theſe men dye the common Death of all men, or if they be viſited af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the viſitation of all men; then the Lord hath not ſent me. But if the Lord make a new thing, and the Earth open her Mouth, and ſwallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the Pit; then ye ſhall underſtand that theſe Men have provoked the Lord. And it came to paſs as he had made an end of ſpeaking all theſe words, that the ground clave aſunder that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them: And the Earth opened her Mouth, and ſwallowed them up, and their Houſes, and all the Men that appertained unto <hi>Kerah,</hi> and all their Goods. They and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the Pit, and the Earth cloſed upon them: and they periſhed from among the Congregation. And all <hi>Iſrael</hi> that were round about them, fled at the cry of them: for they ſaid, Leſt the Earth ſwallow us up alſo. And there came out a Fire from the Lord, and conſumed the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108503:9"/>two hundred and fifty men that offered Incenſe.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Antiquities of the Jews gives the following account of this dreadful Judgment; That <hi>Moſes</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a large Prayer, intermixt with Tears, while he was ſpeaking, the Earth inſtantly trembled, and ſhaking began to move like a Billow of the Sea raiſed by the violence of Wind; at which all the People were ſorely amazed, after which an horrible and ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Noiſe was made about their Tents, and inſtantly the Earth opened and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up both them and all that belonged to them, inſomuch that nothing which was theirs remained to be ſeen; And the Earth in a moment cloſing again the vaſt gaping immediately was ſhut, ſo that there was not the leaſt appearance of what had happened; Thus periſhed they all, leaving behind them an example of Gods Power and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and this accident was the more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable in that there were none, even of their Kinsfolks and Allies that had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them, ſo that the whole People for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting what was paſſed, allowed Gods Juſtice with joyful Acclamations; eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them unworthy to be bewailed, but to accounted as the Plague and Perverters of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108503:10"/>the People. After this, ſaith he, there ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly appeared ſo bright a Fire that the like was never kindled by the hand of man, nor ever broke forth from the Bowels of burning Mountains, nor could proceed from any natural cauſe, but ſuch as ſeemed to be kindled from Heaven, exceeding light and flaming, by the fury and violence of which thoſe two hundred and fifty, together with <hi>Korah,</hi> were ſo conſumed that there ſcarce appeared any relicks of their Carcaſes; On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Aaron</hi> remained untouched, to the end that it might appear this Fire came from Heaven. This was in the year of the World, 2515.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. A third tremendous Earthquake cauſed by the immediate Power of God without any apparent or natural Cauſe, and whereby the Iſraelites gain'd a great Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over the Philiſtines, is in 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 14. <q>And it came to paſs on a Day that <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> the Son of <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid unto the Young Man that bare his Armour, come and let us go over to the Philiſtines Garriſon that is on the other ſide, but he told not his Father. And between the paſſages by which <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſought to go over to the Philiſtines there was a ſharp Rock on the one ſide, and a ſharp Rock on the other
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108503:10"/>ſide. And <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſaid to the young man that bare his Armour, come and let us go over unto the Garriſon of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed, it may be that the Lord will work for us, for there is no reſtraint to the Lord to ſave by many or few; And his Armour-bearer ſaid unto him, Do all that is in thine Heart, turn thee, behold I am with thee according to thy Heart; Then ſaid <hi>Jonathan,</hi> behold we will paſs over unto theſe Men, and we will diſcover our ſelves unto them, if they ſay unto us, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry until we come to you; then we will ſtand ſtill in our place, and will not go up unto them. But if they ſay thus, Come up unto us then we will go up, for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand and this ſhall be a ſign unto us. And both of them diſcovered themſelves to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Philiſtines, and the Philiſtines ſaid; Behold the Hebrews come forth out of their holes, where they had hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, And the men of the Garriſon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his Armour bearer, and ſaid, Come up to us, and we will ſhew you a thing. And <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Armour bearer, Come up after me, for the Lord hath delivered them into the hand of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And <hi>Jonathan</hi> climbed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108503:11"/>up on his Hands and upon his Feet, and his Armour bearer after him, and they fell before <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and his Armour bearer ſlew after him. And that firſt ſlaughter which <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his Armour bearer made was about twenty men within as it were an half Acre of Land, which a yoak of Oxen might Plow. And there was trembling in the Hoſt, in the Field, and among all the People: the Garriſon and the Spoilers they alſo trembled, and the Earth quaked ſo that it was a very great trembling (a trembling of God.) And the Watchmen of <hi>Saul</hi> in <hi>Gibeah</hi> of <hi>Benjamin</hi> looked; and behold the multitude melted away, and they went on, beating down one another. Then ſaid <hi>Saul</hi> unto the People that were with him, Number now and ſee who is gone from us. And when they had numbred, behold <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his Armour-bearer were not there. And <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Ahiah,</hi> Bring hither the Ark of God; (for the Ark of God was at that time with the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>) And it came to paſs that while <hi>Saul</hi> talked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Prieſt, that the noiſe that was in the Hoſt of the Philiſtines went on, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; and <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid unto the Prieſt, withdraw thine hand. And <hi>Saul</hi> and all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108503:11"/>the People that were with him aſſembled themſelves, and they came to the Battel: and behold every mans Swords was againſt his fellow, and there was a great diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philiſtines before that time, which went up with them into the Camp from the Countrey round about, even they alſo turned to be with the Iſraelites that were with <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan.</hi> Likewiſe all the men of Iſrael which had hid themſelves in Mount <hi>Ephraim</hi> when they heard that the Philiſtines fled, even they alſo follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hard after them in the Battel. So the Lord ſaved <hi>Iſrael</hi> that day: and the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel paſſed over unto <hi>Beth-haven.</hi>
               </q> This was about the year of the World, 2940. And <hi>Joſephus</hi> thus deſcribes this Battel; The Philiſtines had pitched their Tents on an pointed Rock which extended it ſelf in length with three Angles, and was on each ſide begirt with a Bank, like a Wall or Fortification againſt the incurſion of their Enemies; The place was fortified by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo that no man might aſcend or attack them without much hazard; yet only <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> and his Armour-bearer, climbing upon their Hands and Feet invaded their Camp, and ſlew about twenty of them
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108503:12"/>which filled their whole Army with terror and amazedneſs, who throwing away their arms, fled amain. Others being ignorant who were their Friends or Foes, invaded one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Enemies, for imagining with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that only two Hebrews durſt never aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend and enter their Camp, they addreſt themſelves to their mutual murder and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo that ſome of them were ſlain, others fled to eſcape the Sword, and fell headlong down the Rocks; The terrible trembling and quaking of the Earth at the ſame time, being doubtleſs very contributary to their deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. A fourth terrible Earthquake hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened from an immediate Divine Power, in the days of <hi>Uzziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> of whom we read in the 2 <hi>Chronicles</hi> 26. (and this Earthquake is likewiſe mentioned by the Prophets <hi>Amos</hi> and <hi>Zachariah</hi>) <q>And <hi>Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord. And he ſought God in the days of <hi>Zechariah</hi> who had Underſtanding in the Viſions of God, and as long as he ſought the Lord, God made him to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And he went forth and Warred againſt the Philiſtines, and God helped him againſt them, and againſt the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:108503:12"/>and the <hi>Ammorites</hi> gave him gifts, and his name ſpread abroad even to the entring in of <hi>Egypt,</hi> for he ſtrengthned himſelf exceedingly.</q> Moreover <hi>Uzziah</hi> had an Hoſt of fighting men, and the whole number of the Fathers of the mighty men of valour, were two thouſand and ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. And under their hand was an Army, three hundred thouſand, and ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and five hundred, that made War with mighty power to help the King againſt the Enemy. <q>But when he was ſtrong his heart was lifted up to his deſtruction, for he tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord his God, and and went into the Temple of the Lord to burn Incenſe upon the Altar of Incenſe. And <hi>Azariah</hi> the Prieſt went in after him, and with him fourſcore Prieſts of the Lord that were valiant men: and they withſtood <hi>Uzziah</hi> the King, and ſaid unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> to burn Incenſe unto the Lord; but to the Prieſts the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> that are conſecrated to burn Incenſe: Go out of the Sanctuary, for thou haſt treſpaſſed, neither ſhall it be for thine honour from the Lord God. Then <hi>Uzziah</hi> was wrath, and had a Cenſer in his hand to burn Incenſe, and while he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108503:13"/>was wrath with the Prieſts, the Leproſie even roſe up in his Forehead before the Prieſts in the Houſe of the Lord from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Incenſe Altar. And <hi>Azariah</hi> the Cheif Prieſt, and all the Prieſts looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and behold he was Leprous in his Forehead and they thruſt him out from thence, yea he himſelf haſted alſo to go out becauſe the Lord had ſmitten him. And <hi>Uzziah</hi> the King was a Leper unto the Day of his Death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now though here is no mention made of the Earthquake that happened in his Reign, which is recorded by <hi>Amos</hi> and <hi>Zachariah</hi> as aforeſaid, particularly by the laſt in <hi>Chapter</hi> 14. And ye ſhall flee like as ye fled before the Earthquake in the days of <hi>Uzziah;</hi> yet <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Jews makes it very evident that it was at this time, and upon this occaſion; <hi>Uzziah,</hi> ſays he, upon a certain ſolemn Feaſt day, wherein all the People were aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, attired himſelf in the High Prieſts Veſtmente, and entred into the Temple to offer Sacrifice unto God upon the Golden Altar, notwithſtanding the High Prieſt <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,</hi> accompanied with fourſcore Prieſts prohibited the ſame, telling him, that it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108503:13"/>was not lawful for him to Sacrifice, ſince it was only allowed to thoſe that were of the Poſterity of the High Prieſt <hi>Aaron,</hi> whilſt after this manner <hi>Azariah</hi> expoſtulated with him, commanding him to go out of the Temple, and not to invade the Ordinances of God; The King waxed wrath, and threatned to take his life from him, unleſs he kept himſelf quiet. Whereupon there fell a great Trembling and Earthquake, and the Temple cleft in twain, and a great light of the Sun entred thereinto, and reflected on the Kings Face in ſuch manner that all his body was covered with a Leproſy: And before the City, in a place called <hi>Eroge,</hi> the half of a Mountain that ſtood to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward brake and fell, and rolled and remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſpace of four Furlongs, toward the Oriental Mountain where it reſted; So that the publick ways were ſtopt and choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and the Kings Gardens of Pleaſure were wholly ruinated and disfigured. When the Prieſts beheld the Kings Face covered with a Leproſie, they told him what incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience had happened to him, and enjoyned him to depart out of the City, according to the cuſtom of men that were polluted; Whereupon he wholly confuſed at ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous an accident, and having no farther
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108503:14"/>courage to reply, obeyed the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was given him, enduring a pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and lamentable puniſhment for being proud and presumptuous, in committing ſuch Impiety againſt God. Finally he died through grief and diſcontent, and was Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in his own Garden. In the year of the World, 3194.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. The next Earthquake that we read of, is that which happened at the death of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, and was a very convincing demonſtration of his Deity and that he was the Son of God. As we find in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 27. <q>Now from the ſixth hour there was Darkneſs over all the Land until the ninth hour. Jeſus when he had cried again, gave up the Ghoſt. And behold the Vail of the Temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom, and the Earth did quake, and the Rocks rent. And the Graves were opened, and many Bodies of Saints which ſlept aroſe. And came out of the Graves after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and went into the Holy City and appeared unto many. Now when the Centurion and they that were with him watching Jeſus, ſaw the Earthquake and thoſe things that were done, they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108503:14"/>greatly, ſaying, Truly this was the Son of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe prodigious effects that were produced upon our Saviour's Crucifixion, were acknowledged and atteſted as well by Heathens as Chriſtians. At the time of his Death a very great darkneſs happened in the Day time, which continued from ſix a Clock till nine, and yet there was no Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe of the Sun, for it was at a Full Mood; ſo that it was Miraculous, and contrary to the Order of Nature, and only by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Power of God, who deprived the Sun of its Light for that ſpace of time. And therefore <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> the Arcopagite being that Day in <hi>Athens,</hi> and ſeeing the Sun ſo dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and alſo knowing, as a Man learned in the courſe of the Heavens, that ſuch an Ecclipſe muſt needs be contrary to the Rule of Nature, ſpake with a loud voice, ſaying, Either the World is at an end or the God of Nature Suffers.</p>
            <p>We like wiſe read of another Supernatural Earthquake at the Reſurrection of Chriſt St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 28. <q>In the end of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath as it began to dawn toward the firſt day of the Week, came <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and the other <hi>Mary</hi> to ſee the Sepulchre. And behold there was a great Earthquake;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108503:15"/>for the Angel of the Deſcended from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and came and rolled back the Stone from the Door, and ſate upon it. His countenance was like Lightning, and his Raiment white as Snow. And for fear of him, the Keepers did ſhake, and became as dead men.</q> This was in the year of the World 4036.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. Laſtly, We read of two Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes in the Acts of the Apoſtles, which can be attributed to no other cauſe but that of the Power of God, for the confirmation of the Goſpel, and the Reſurrection of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. The firſt is in <hi>Acts</hi> 4.31. <q>And when they had prayed the Earth was ſhaken where the Apoſtles were aſſembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and they ſpake the Word of God with boldneſs.</q> The ſecond is in <hi>Acts</hi> 17. <q>And at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> Prayed and Sang Praiſes to God, and the Priſoners heard them. And ſuddenly there was a great Earthquake, ſo that the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Priſon were ſhaken; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately all the Doors were opened, and every ones Bands were loſed. And the Keeper of the Priſon awaking out of his ſleep, and ſeeing the Priſon Doors open,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108503:15"/>he drew out his Sword and would have Killed himſelf, ſuppoſing that the Priſoners had been fled. But <hi>Paul</hi> cried with a loud voice ſaying, Do thy ſelf no harm; for we are all here. Then he called for a Light, and ſprang in and came trembling and fell down before <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas.</hi> And brought them out and ſaid, Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved? and they ſaid believe on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved and thy Houſe. And they ſpake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his Houſe. And he took them the ſame hour in the Night, and waſhed their ſtripes, and was baptized he and all his ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And when he had brought them into his Houſe, he ſet meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his Houſe.</q> This was in the 55 year after our Saviours Incarnation.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. Theſe are all the Earthquakes that we find mentioned in Holy Scripture, to have actually happened, but there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpoken of, which may be termed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical Earthquakes, and may ſignify great Alterations and Commotions in the ſeveral States and Kingdoms of the World; wherein, by the ſhaking, moving, remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, breaking down and diſſolving the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108503:16"/>Earth, we may underſtand the Inhabitants of the Earth, and the puniſhments that God would inflict upon them for their repeated Sins and Provocations; ſuch as theſe we find <hi>Iſaiah</hi> threatning the Narion of the Jews withal, in the 29th Chapter of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. <q>Thou ſhalt be viſited of the Lord of Hoſts with Thunder, and with Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, and great noiſe, with Storm and Tempeſt, and the flame of devouring Fire. And in <hi>Chapter</hi> 24. And it ſhall come to paſs, that he who fleeth from the noiſe of the fear ſhall fall into the Pit: and he that cometh out of the midſt of the Pit ſhall be taken in the ſnare, for the Windows from on high are open, and the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth do ſhake. The Earth is is utterly broken down, the Earth is clean diſſolved, the Earth is moved exceedingly. The Earth ſhall real too and fro like a Drunkard, and ſhall be removed like a Cottage, and the tranſgreſſion thereof ſhall be heavy upon it, and ſhall fall and not riſe again.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="16">XVI. And our bleſſed Saviour foretelling the deſtruction of the Temple, and what great Earthquakes ſhall be before it, and of the Signs of his coming to Judgment. St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. he ſays; <q>And ye ſhall hear of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108503:16"/>Wars and Rumours of Wars, For Nation ſhall riſe againſt Nation, and Kingdom againſt Kingdom; and there ſhall be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, and Peſtilences, and Earthquakes, in divers places, and the Sun ſhall be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the Moon ſhall not give her Light, and the Stars ſhall fall from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Powers of the Heavens ſhall be ſhaken. And then ſhall appear the Sign of the Son of Man, and he ſhall ſend his Angels with a great ſound of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and they ſhall gather together his Elect from the four Winds, from one end of Heaven to the other.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="17">XVII. Such Metaphorical Earthquakes are thoſe thought to be, which are Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of in ſeveral places of the Revelations, as <hi>Chapter</hi> 6. <q>And I beheld when the Lamb had opened the ſixth Seal, and lo, there was a great Earthquake, and the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came black as Sack-cloth of Hair, and the Moon became as Blood. And the Stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth, even as the Fig-tree caſteth her untimely Figs, when ſhe is ſhaken of a mighty Wind. And the Heaven departed as a Scrowl when it is rolled together, and every Mountain and Iſland were moved out of their places. And the Kings of the Earth, and the great
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108503:17"/>men, and the rich men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty Men, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bondman, and every Freeman hid themſelves in the Dens, and in the Rocks of the Mountains; And ſaid to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the Face of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb; For the great day of his Wrath is come; and who ſhall be able to ſtand.</q> So in <hi>Chapter</hi> 8. <q>And the Angel took the Cenſer and filled it with Fire of the Altar, and caſt it into the Earth: and there were Voices, and Thundrings, and Lightnings, and an Earthquake. And again in <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 11. And they heard a great Voice from Heaven ſaying unto the Witneſſes, Come up hither, and they aſcended up to Heaven in a Cloud, and their Enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them. And the ſeventh Angel ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and there were great Voices in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſaying, The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall Reign for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever. And the four and twenty Elders which ſate before God on their Seats, fell upon their Faces and Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped God, ſaying, We give thee thanks O Lord God Almighty, which art and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108503:17"/>waſt, and art to come; becauſe thou haſt taken; to thee thy great Power and haſt Reigned, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. And the Nations were angry, and thy Wrath is come, and the time of the Dead that they ſhould be Judged, and that thou ſhouldeſt give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to thy Servants the Prophets, and to the Saints and them that fear thy name ſmall and great, and ſhouldeſt deſtroy them which deſtroy the Earth. And the Temple of God was opened in Heaven, and there was ſeen in his Temple the Ark of his Teſtament; and there were Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and Voices, and Thundrings, and an Earthquake, and great Hail.</q> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in <hi>Chapter</hi> 16. <q>And the ſeventh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel poured his Vial into the Air, and there was a great Earthquake, and there came a great Voice out of the Temple of Heaven from the Throne, ſaying, It is done. And there were Voices, and Thunders, and Lightnings, and there was a great Earthquake, ſuch as was not ſince men were upon the Earth, ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty an Earthquake and ſo great. And the great City was divided into three parts, and the Cities of the Nation fell, and great <hi>Babylon</hi> came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the Cup of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108503:18"/>the Wine of the fierceneſs of his Wrath, And every Iſland fled away, and the Mountains were not found. And there fell upon Men a great Hail out of Heaven, every Stone about the weight of a Talent: and men Blaſphemed God becauſe of the Plague of the Hail; for the plague there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was exceeding great.</q> Theſe and ſuch other Scriptures may denote the future Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities that will befal the Inhabitants of the Earth about the end of the World, and do alſo demonſtrate the great power and alſufficiency of Almighty God, who as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith <hi>Chapter</hi> 9. <q>Is wiſe in Heart, and mighty in Strength, who removeth the Mountains, and overturneth them in his anger. Who ſhaketh the Earth out of her place, and the Pillars thereof tremble</q>

            <p n="18">XVIII. Having given an account of the Supernatural and Metaphorical Earthquakes recorded in Holy Writ; I ſhall now relate thoſe that are mentioned by other Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of the former and latter Ages, and likewiſe of ſome of the Conſequents which have ſucceeded them as to Wars, Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Famines and other dreadful Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and were judged to be the effects of them; wherein I ſhall be obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat ſome of thoſe already publiſhed in a

            </p>
            <p n="19">XIX. Before the birth of Saviour <hi>Plato</hi> mentions a wonderful Earthquake, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in a Day and a Night a vaſt Iſland with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Streights of <hi>Gibralter</hi> called <hi>Atlantis,</hi> and bigger than <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> together, was wholly overwhelmed, and afterward covered by a great Inundation of Waters, inſomuch that on the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean for a great while after no Ship could Sail, by reaſon that the ſame huge Sea by reſolution of the Earth of that mighty Iſland was all turned into Mud. He alſo Writes, that by another terrible Earthquake the Continent of <hi>Africa</hi> was rent aſunder, from <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> as it is at this day, being now only connected by a little Neck of Land at the Red Sea. The famous Iſle of <hi>Sicily</hi> was likewiſe formerly a part of <hi>Italy,</hi> and by an Earthquake divided from it. And our Iſland of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> is ſuppoſed to be broken off from the Continent of <hi>France</hi> by that means. <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſaith that <hi>Egypt</hi> in ancient time was a Gulph of the Sca, and by an Earthquake made a dry Land. The River <hi>Indus</hi> in <hi>Aſia</hi> which receives fifteen others Rivers into it, altered its Channel and the neighbouring Countrey was turned
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108503:19"/>into a Wilderneſs by a lamentable Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. Before the Peloponeſian, or Civil Wars among the Grecians, one of their Iſlands called <hi>Delphos</hi> famous for the Oracle and Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> ſcituated therein, was wholly ruined by an Earthquake, which was thought to portend thoſe remarkable alterations which ſoon after happened in <hi>Greece.</hi> A little before the Wars between the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and the <hi>Ilotae,</hi> who were their Slaves and Bondmen in the Countrey of <hi>Laconia,</hi> there happened in the City of <hi>Sparta</hi> a moſt terrible and fearful Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, for the Earth in many places of the Countrey opened and fell in as into a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit. The Mountain <hi>Taygetum</hi> ſhook ſo terribly that parts of Rocks fell down from it, and <hi>Sparta</hi> with two other Cities with the violence of it were thrown to the ground, five hundred Houſes only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; And great flouds of Water follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, the Countrey was almoſt utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thereby. <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon</hi> ſuffered exceedingly by Earthquakes, and an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of People were buried under the ruins. And <hi>Strabo</hi> mentions a City ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate about <hi>Sidon</hi> that was wholly ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up thereby. <hi>Pliny</hi> writes of twelve Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ruined in one Night, and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:108503:19"/>is cited for what is more ſtrange, That in a ſamous Earthquake a hundred Cities in <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> were deſtroyed. In the Veliternean Fields the Earth rent aſunder in ſuch huge and frightful breaches, that Trees and whole Houſes were ſwallowed up in them, and it Rained Bloud for two whole days together, about which time <hi>Hannibal</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that notable overthrow by <hi>Scipio,</hi> which was the deſtruction of the famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Republick of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of that Country to the Romans. <hi>Tit. Livius. Hiſt. Joſephus</hi> records that about twenty nine years before the birth of Chriſt, there happened a tremendous Earthquake in the Country of <hi>Judea,</hi> whereby divers Beaſts were ſlain, and many People over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in the ruins of their Houſes, and periſhed, to the number as ſome write of about thirty thouſand.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. I now proceed, in a Chronological Order, to relate all the Earthquakes that have happened ſince our Saviours Birth, as I find them mentioned by ſeveral Authors, of which that which happened at his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion is ſaid to be the greateſt that ever was, which ſhook not only one part of the Earth as in other caſes, but the whole Would trembled at once, if ſome famous
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108503:20"/>Authors are to be credited. In the tenth year of Chriſt was a great Earthquake in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> that overthrew many Cities, and in his ſevententh year thirteen Cities in <hi>Italy</hi> were deſtroyed, and the River <hi>Tyber</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed <hi>Rome.</hi> The effects whereof were thought to be, That <hi>Sejanus</hi> the Favourite to <hi>Tyberius</hi> was executed for his Ambition, his Son ſtrangled, his Daughter firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowred by the Hangman, then put to death. <hi>Druſius</hi> is Poiſoned; <hi>Tyberius</hi> turn'd Tyrant. In 59. was a terrible Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe of the Sun, ſo that the Stars were ſeen, <hi>Nero</hi>'s Supper was burned with Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and a great Earthquake happened at <hi>Rome.</hi> At this time the Brittains ſlay ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty thouſand Romans, and <hi>Suetonius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys eighty thouſand Brittains as he comes from <hi>Angleſey. Rome</hi> is fired by <hi>Nero</hi> who rejoices in that Villany, he commits Inceſt with his own Mother, afterwards Murders and Rips her up to view the place where he lay before he was born. <hi>Cartiſmunda</hi> Queen of the Brittains rejecteth her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the King of <hi>Scots</hi> takes her, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries her alive.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. In the reign of <hi>Trojan</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror 105. there happened a moſt terrible Earthquake at <hi>Antioch</hi> which deſtroyed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108503:20"/>Cities and People, and extended it ſelf very far; Frightful Lightnings which made the Night as light as Day, preceded with dreadful Thunderbolts that threw down ſtately buildings, killed many men; Alſo ſtrong and unuſual Storms of Wind, after which were heard great and ſudden Noiſes, the Sea wrought, the Waves ſwelled, the Earth was ſhaken, buildings trembled, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were lifted up and fell down, whereby ſo thick a duſt and darkneſs was raiſed that People could not ſee nor hear one another, nor ſcarcely breath: Trees were pluckt up by the Roots, and multitudes buried in the Ruins of their own Houſes. After which came ſuch violent heats that People not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to indure it, ſtript and hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves naked under ground, where many were famiſhed, by reaſon the continual ſhaking of the Earth ſo diſtracted them that they durſt not come forth for relief. In 107. A very great Earthquake happened in <hi>Aſia,</hi> with many Prodigious ſights in the Air, as ſighting of Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Another in <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> where Lightning from Heaven conſumed the Temple of their Gods, with ſtrong unwonted Winds, and horrible Noiſes in the Earth. In 120. A great Earthquake in <hi>Nice;</hi> and two terrible
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108503:21"/>ones in <hi>Paleſtina.</hi> Milk in a Prodigious manner rained in <hi>Rome,</hi> and a great Fire deſtroyed two hundred and forty Houſes. In 162. A very great Earthquake in <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynia;</hi> The Waves of the Mediterranean Seas in a Calm elevated themſelves to the top of a Mountain far diſtant from it, and caſt the foam a great way upon the main Land. At this time <hi>Mogul</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> growing odious to the Nobility for his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny they Murder him. <hi>Smyrna</hi> in <hi>Aſia</hi> is quite deſtroyed. The Emperor <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> groweth rediculous, and the People taking notice thereof, he executed many of them, he is ſtrangled by <hi>Martia</hi> his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, and <hi>Pertinax</hi> ſucceeding, after having Reigned only eighty ſeven days is ſlain by the Souldiers.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. In 244. The Sun was totally Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed, and there was ſo horrid an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, the Earth gaped ſo extreamly that certain Cities, together with their People, were ſwallowed up, and exceeding great darkneſs happened for many days together. Now the tenth Perſecution began wherein one hundred forty four thouſand Chriſtians were put to Death in <hi>Egypt</hi> and ſeventy thouſand baniſhed, and many burned in an Houſe in <hi>Nicomedia.</hi> In the year 300.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108503:21"/>there were great Earthquakes, by one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thirteen Cities in <hi>Campania</hi> were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and another in <hi>Aſia.</hi> A hand was ſeen in the Church of <hi>Lateran</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Body, which in the ſight of many men writ upon the Wall theſe words, <q>
                  <hi>Hodie venenum in Eccleſia infuſurus.</hi> To day is Poiſon poured into the Church;</q> Which was thought to intend the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary indulgence of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and firſt Chriſtian Emperor upon the Biſhops, and his heaping Honours and Eſtates upon them, whereby they degenerated from their Primitive ſimplicity and humility. Soon after many Cities in the Eaſt fell to the ground by an Earthquake, and <hi>Neo-Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi> was overturned and all its Inhabitants periſhed, except ſuch as were ſaved by the Biſhop in the Church. <hi>Dyracchium</hi> was demoliſhed by an Earthquake, and <hi>Rome</hi> trembled for three Days and Nights ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, and <hi>Antioch</hi> was indangered by an Earthquake of a whole years continuance. <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> were likewiſe endama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereby, and likewiſe <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was ſo general that all <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> were ſhaken at once.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. In 366. in the reign of <hi>Julian</hi> the Emperor, who was firſt a Chriſtian and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108503:22"/>afterward revolted to Paganiſm, for which he was named the Apoſtate, and became a bitter Enemy to the Chriſtians, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight and contempt of our bleſſed Saviour, who had Propheſied that the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed and never rebuilt, He impiouſly reſolved to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the ſame, and deſigned to build it Magnificently with exceſſive coſt and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, committing the care thereof to one <hi>Alypius,</hi> who did vigorouſly apply himſelf to the Work, being aſſiſted therein by the Governour of the Province. But there brake out dreadful Balls of Fire near the Foundation of the Walls, which with their frequent Irruptions, made the Place unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable, ſeveral Workmen being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the Fire, and in this manner a full period was put to their further proceeding therein; But <hi>Niciphorus Caliſtus</hi> gives a more large and full Narrative thereof as followeth. The Jews, ſaith he, having got together as many as were skilful in the Art of Building, and having provided Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for it, and fully cleanſed the place, they prepared Spades made of Silver, their charges being allowed out of the publick ſtock: with ſuch Earneſtneſs and Alacrity did they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour herein, that the very Women carried
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108503:22"/>away the Rubbiſh in their Laps, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Jewels, or precious Ornaments they had, they expended on the buſineſs. When they had digged up the remainders of the old Building from the loweſt Foundations, and had cleared the ground, ſo that <q>there was not a ſtone left upon a ſtone,</q> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Bleſſed Lords Prediction, The next day coming to the place, there was a great Earthquake, inſomuch that the ſtones were caſt our of the Foundation, ſo that many of the Jews were ſlain, who either came to ſee the work, or had the overſight thereof. The Publick buildings which were neareſt the Temple, were likewiſe looſned, and falling down with great violence, buried thoſe who were in them in their ruines; ſome who attempted to fly away, were found half dead; others loſt their Legs, Arms, Hands, and other Members, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the force of that ſudden accident ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them. The Earthquake was ſcarce over, but thoſe who remained fell to work again. But when they attempted it the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, ſudden flaſhes of Fire violently iſſued out of the Foundations, and other Fire fell furiouſly from Heaven, and deſtroyed more than before, conſuming to Aſhes the Hammers, Graving Tools, Saws, Hatchets,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108503:23"/>Axes, and all other Inſtruments which the Workmen had brought for their Service; the flames continuing a whole day together. When <hi>Cyril,</hi> who was at that time Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaw theſe things, he conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his mind the words of the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> to which Chriſt alſo had ſet his Seal in the Holy Goſpel, and then told them all; <q>That now was the time, when the Oracle of our Saviour had its accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</q> which ſaid, That a Stone ſhould not be left upon a Stone in the Temple; which when he had ſaid, a dreadful Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake aſſailed the remaining Foundations, and caſting out all the reſt of the Stones, diſperſed them abroad, and a fearful Storm aroſe, which whirled in the Air many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Buſhels of Lime and Plaiſter, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den flames of Fire flaſhing from beneath, burnt up in a moment an innumerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of People, who were either labouring in the work, or coming to behold it. Thus did the wicked <hi>Julian</hi> fulfil Chriſts Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions concerning <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by the ſame means whereby he deſigned to make them void.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. In 367. in the Reign of <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Valentinian</hi> Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> there happen'd ſuch horrible Earthquakes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108503:23"/>the Weſtern Empire, as neither True Hiſtorians have related the like, nor Fables themſelves repreſented to us. A little after the day dawned there was a great Tempeſt of Thunder and Lightning, which was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſuch a dreadful trembling of the Earth, that the Sea alſo was ſhaken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and deſerted the ſhore and its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient bounds for a great ſpace, and the depths of its Channels were diſcovered; multitudes of Fiſh were ſeen to ſtick in the Mud, and many plowed Fields became Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable, the inequality of the Seas bottom appeared, here Hills, and there Vallies which had never before ſeen the Sun, ſince, at the original of all things, they were firſt overwhelmed with the Flouds. Many Ships were left on the dry ground, and ſwarme of People flew thither to catch Fiſh; when ſuddenly the Sea, as diſdaining to be impriſoned, returned to its former ſtation with ſuch impetuoſity, that it over-ran its former bounds, and with the fury thereof overthrew a multitude of Towns and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with many thouſands of People, and great numbers of Ships were overwhelmed, ſome of which, with the violence thereof, were blown upon the tops of Houſes. Soon after a great Rebellion happened, and the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108503:24"/>Northern Nations came in like a Floud, and over-ran the Roman Empire, which was thought to be preſaged by this lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table accident.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. In 430. A great Earthquake ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in divers places, and overturned many Cities, the Wall of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> though but new built, it threw to the ground with 57 Turrets; Alſo Stones of great bulk, lately placed there, fell down, many Town, were ruined. Yea ſome Authors affirm that it was ſo terrible as to affect almoſt the whole World, the Earth gaped and ſwallowed up many Villages; Fountains were dried up, and Waters brake forth in places formerly dry. Great Trees were torn up by the Roots; Heaps of Earth were ſo ſhaken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether that they were raiſed into Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. The Sea threw up dead Fiſhes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Iſlands were ſunk and overwhelmed, Ships ſailing on the Sea were ſuddenly left on dry ground. In ſhort many places of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and both the <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi>'s were grievouſly diſtreſt thereby. This diſaſter continued ſix months without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and the People of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> not daring to ſtay in the City for fear of the fall of their Houſes, continued together with their good Emperor, and their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108503:24"/>in the Fields, inſtant in Prayers to the Almighty for the removal of ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Judgment. After the danger was over, the Emperor repaired the Walls of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> which were much endamaged thereby. This was judged a Sign of the Death of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> which ſoon after follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of ſeveral changes which happened at the ſame time in divers parts of the World.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. In 454. A great Earthquake at <hi>Rome,</hi> another at <hi>Vienna,</hi> Wolves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beaſts wander all the year through the City and devour men. An Earthquake in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with two wonderful Blazing Stars. About this time the <hi>Brittains</hi> beat the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and drive them into the Iſle of <hi>Thanet.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> Rebel in <hi>Egypt</hi> and Kill two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, and forced thoſe that ſurvived to eat the dead. They ſlay two hundred and forty thouſand in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and at laſt are ſlain themſelves. A great Famine in <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The <hi>Goths</hi> waſt <hi>Thrace, Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Epirus: Gratian</hi> killeth thirty five thouſand <hi>Germans; Maxinius</hi> ſlayeth <hi>Gratian</hi> treacherouſly, and poſſeſſeth <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, France, Spain</hi> and <hi>Africk.</hi> The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Apollo Daphneus</hi> is burnt. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Temples are ſhut up by the Chriſtian
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108503:25"/>Emperors, and their Idols deſtroyed. In 458. A great Earthquake happened at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> which the Citizens had ſad cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. Before it began ſome of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were ſeized with an extraordinary madneſs, ſuch as ſeemed to exceed the fury of Wild Beaſts, and to be the preſage of that Calamity which followed ſoon after; For about the Fourth hour of the night in <hi>September,</hi> almoſt all the buildings of the new City were overturned, which was well peopled and none of it forſaken or empty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curiouſly built by the Magnificence of divers Emperors, who ſtrove to exceed each other in the adornment of it. The firſt and ſecond Fabricks in the Palace were alſo caſt down, the reſt ſtanding together with a Bath, which having formerly been neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected now when by the Earthquake the reſt were choaked up ſtood the Citizens in very good ſtead.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. In the firſt Century was a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Earthquake in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and another in <hi>Paleſtina</hi> and a third at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for ſix weeks together. It rained Bloud in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and at <hi>York</hi> the Fountains ran Bloud: a Dragon and many Serpents were ſeen in the River <hi>Tyber.</hi> After this ſo terrible a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine raged in <hi>Brittain</hi> that the People aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108503:25"/>in great numbers to caſt themſelves into the Sea; A Plague ſo great in <hi>Rome</hi> that 800 men fell dead in an hour in the time of Proceſſion. <hi>Brunchild,</hi> a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> being found guilty of the death of ten Kings; She is tyed by the Hair of the Head and the Arms to Wild Horſes, and torn to pieces. The Jews and Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes Perſecute the Chriſtians, and burn their Churches in <hi>Caeſaria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. In the ſixth ſeventh and eighth Centuries, an Earthquake at <hi>Antioch;</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> another in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Normandy;</hi> a fiery Dragon was ſeen in the Skies, and divers other dreadful Prodigies. About the ſame time there was a violent Earthquake at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> which laſted many days, and every hour the City ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed extraordinary ſhocks. Many houſes were thrown down, but the People betook themſelves to Prayer, Faſting and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the Almighty had compaſſion on them; Many Cities in the Eaſt were ruined by it, and the City of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was ſore ſhaken therewith, which was the more aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing becauſe it ſeldom happens in thoſe parts. Some years after, <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was again ſhaken ſo violently that not only the Walls and Churches but all <hi>Greece</hi>

            <p n="39">XXXIX. In 1590. The Election of Pope <hi>Urban</hi> VII. was ſignalized by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake which made <hi>Auſtria, Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Moravia</hi> to tremble, and was followed by an extraordinary Dearth; <hi>Gregory</hi> XIV. quickly ſucceeded and died in ten months. There was ſuch a Famine and Plague in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> that year that above threeſcore thouſand Perſons died. In 1591. In St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Iſland in the Weſt Indies, there happened an Earthquake which continued about ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days, to the extream terror of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108503:35"/>French who inhabite there, eſpecially when by the force thereof they perceived the Earth to remove from place to place, and <hi>Villa Franca</hi> their principal Town overthrown, the Ships that then road at Anchor in the Bay, trembled and quaked; inſomuch that the People thought the Day of Judgment was come. In 1593. Another terrible Earthquake happened in <hi>Perſia,</hi> which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned three thouſand Houſes in the City of <hi>Lair</hi> cruſhing to Death above three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Perſons in their ruins; yea the Caſtle though built upon a ſolid Rock groaned under the like affrighting downfall.

Not long after ſo horrible an Earthquake happened in another of the Iſlands of <hi>Azores</hi> called St. <hi>Michael</hi> aforementioned, that not far from thence the Sea opened, and thruſt forth an Iſland above a League and half in length at a place where there was above a hundred and fifty Fathom Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

            <p n="40">XL. In 1618. The Town of <hi>Pleurs</hi> in <hi>Switzerland</hi> was overwhelmed by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake of which we have the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the late Travels of a Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in that Countrey. This place conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in about two thouſand two hundred Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants and magnificently built, for beſides the great Palace of the <hi>Francken</hi> that coſt ſome Millions, there were many other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, erected by ſeveral Rich Factors both of <hi>Milan,</hi> and other Parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> who liked the Scituation and Air as well as the freedom of the Government of this place; ſo they uſed to come hither during the Heats, and here they gave themſelves all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences that a vaſt wealth could furniſh; By one of the Palaces that was a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Town, which was not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, one may judg of the reſt; It was an Out-houſe of the Family of the <hi>Francken,</hi> and yet it may compare with many Palaces in <hi>Italy,</hi> and certainly Houſe and Gardens could not coſt ſo little as one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns. The Voluptuouſneſs of this Place became very crying, and Madam <hi>de Salis</hi> told me, ſaith my Author, that ſhe often heard her Mother relate ſome Paſſages of a Proteſtant Miniſters Sermons, who Preached in a little Church which thoſe of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108503:36"/>the Religion had there, and warned them frequently of the terrible Judgments of God, that were hanging over their heads, and that he believed would ſuddenly break in upon them. On the 25 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1618. an Inhabitant came and perſuaded them to be gone, for he ſaw the Mountains cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but he was laughed at for his pains; He had a Daughter whom he prevailed with to leave all and go with him, but when ſhe was gone out of the Town with him, ſhe called to mind that ſhe had not lockt the Door of a Room in which ſhe had ſome things of value, and ſo ſhe went back to do that, and was buried with the reſt; for at the hour of Supper the Hill fell down, and buried the Town and all the Inhabitants, ſo that none eſcaped. The fall of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains did ſo fill the Channels of the River that the firſt news thoſe of the <hi>Chavennes</hi> had of it, was by the failing of the River, for three or four hours there came not a drop of Water, but the River wrought for it ſelf a new courſe and returned to them. I could hear no perticular Character of the Man who eſcaped, ſo I muſt leave the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret reaſon of ſo ſingular a preſervation to the great diſcovery at the laſt day, of thoſe ſteps of Divine Providence that are now ſo
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108503:36"/>unaccountable. Some of the Family of the <hi>Francken,</hi> got ſome Miners to work under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground to find out the Wealth that was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied in their Palace; for beſides their Plate and Futniture, there was a great Caſh and many Jewels in the Houſe: the Miners pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they could find nothing: But they went to their Countrey of <hi>Tirol</hi> and built fine Houſes, and a great Wealth appeared, of which no other viſible account could be given but this, that they had found ſome of that Treaſure.</p>
            <p n="41">XLI. In 1622. Was a great Earthquake in <hi>Italy;</hi> The ſhape of an Elephant was ſeen in the Air, and three Suns. Armies fighting, Monſtrous births, Waters turned into bloud, unuſual and impetuous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts which overthrew ſeveral Towers. At this time began the third Civil War in <hi>France,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> is taken and ſhot to Death with a Piſtol.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108503:37"/>of <hi>France</hi> is ſlain. Nine hundred thouſand Moors are expelled <hi>Spain.</hi> The Hollanders beat the Spaniards in the South Sea. The <hi>Tartars</hi> Invade <hi>Podolia,</hi> they burn four Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and four hundred Villages, and carry from thence a vaſt booty. The Jeſuits and Papiſts are expelled the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> In 1627. An Earthquake happened in <hi>England</hi> and a great fiery Beam was ſeen in the Air in <hi>France.</hi> Six Suns in <hi>Cornwall</hi> at once, and five Moons in <hi>Normandy.</hi> In 1627. <hi>July</hi> 31. happened an Earthquake in <hi>Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> whereby in the City of <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> alone ten thouſand Souls were taken out of the World, and in the horror of ſuch infinite ruins, and ſepulchre of ſo many Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, a great Bell thrown out of the Steeple by the Earthquake fell ſo fitly over a Child that it incloſed him, and doing him no harm made a Bulwark for him againſt any other danger. Strange and wonderful were the Prodigies that were ſeen in <hi>Germany</hi> both in the Heavens, Earth and Waters, before the beginning of that Bloody War in thoſe Countreys, and which plainly preſaged the enſuing miſeries and deſolations which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened there, and began about 1631. In which year, not long before the troubles of <hi>Naples,</hi> there happened a terrible Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:108503:37"/>in and about that City; and the Mountain of <hi>Soma</hi> after many terrible bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowings, vomited out burning ſtreams of Fire which tumbled into the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea; and caſt out an huge deal of Aſhes. The like happened the year following with great damage and loſs to the Neighbouring places both in Houſes, People and Cattel. And in <hi>Apulia</hi> ſeventeen thouſand Perſons were deſtroyed by the ſame.</p>
            <p n="42">XLII. In the year 1638. Six Suns were ſeen at once in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and ſeveral Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions of men in the Heavens preparing to fight with each other; Alſo Navys of Ships were viſible in the Sky. The <hi>Scots</hi> at this time make an Inſurrection, the King goes in Perſon to appeaſe them, they renounce the Biſhops and Prelacy, and ſet up Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in <hi>Scotland.</hi> In this year 1638. hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a Terrible Earthquake in the Iſland of St. <hi>Michael</hi> one of the <hi>Azores,</hi> or <hi>Terce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s belonging to the Spaniards in the <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Ocean Weſtward. Upon <hi>June</hi> 26. this Iſland began unverſally to quake and tremble, which continued eight days, ſo that the People leaving the Cities, Towns and Caſtles, were forced to live in the open Fields: After which this Prodigy ſucceeded; Six miles diſtant from the Hill or Pick of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108503:38"/>
               <hi>Camerine,</hi> at a place called <hi>Ferriera;</hi> where Fiſhermen with their Boats uſe to fiſh in Summer, they at this time caught ſuch a multitude, that no Boat returned with leſs than Ten Thouſand Fiſh. At this very place in <hi>July</hi> this very year, Fire broke forth with ſuch unexpreſſible violence, notwithſtanding the depth of the Ocean, which had been fathomed one hundred and twenty foot deep, that the very Sea it ſelf was not ſufficient to extinguiſh ſuch mighty flames; The ſpace of this boyling Fire was about two Acres, and the Fire aroſe with ſuch mighty force, that it reached even to the Clouds, carrying with it Water, Sand, Earth, Stones and much other matter, which like Feather-Beds flew into the Air to the terror of the Beholders afar off, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down again into the water, reſembled a kind of <hi>Pultis</hi> or <hi>Frumentie;</hi> and had not the Wind by Divine Providence blown off from the Iſle into the Sea, and thereby dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven back this outragious Fire, without doubt the whole Countrey had been utterly burnt up and deſtroyed by this formidable Combuſtion; ſoon after it caſt forth ſtones of ſo vaſt a bigneſs, to the height of above three lances, that they ſeemed rather like entire Mountains than Stones, which in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108503:38"/>their fall meeting and daſhing againſt others they broke into a Thouſand pieces, with a terrible noiſe and ratling, which afterward being taken up mouldred into a black Sand. Moreover out of this vaſt quantity of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thrown out, a new Iſland aroſe, even in the midſt of the deep Ocean. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was not above five Acres, but increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing continually in four days after, it took up the length of five mile; ſo vaſt a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Fiſh periſhed by this burning, that eight Ships of <hi>India</hi> could hardly contain them, and being diſperſed about all parts of the Iſland were gathered together, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in deep Ditches by the Inhabitants for eighteen miles round about to prevent any Contagion which might ariſe from them, but the <hi>Sulphur</hi> or <hi>Brimſtone</hi> was ſmelt Twenty four Miles.

            </p>
            <p n="43">XLIII. The ſame year 1638, the Learned <hi>Rircherus</hi> made a ſearch and diſcovery into the burning Mountain of <hi>Veſuvius</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> ſo famous for fiery ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions for many Ages, which being one of the moſt tremendous <hi>Miracles of Nature</hi> I ſhall relate in his own words; After ſo great dangers ſuſtained by Sea and Land in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108503:39"/>diligently ſearching out the incredible power of Nature working in Burroughs and Paſſages under ground, I had a great deſire to inform my ſelf concerning <hi>Veſuvius.</hi> I went therefore to <hi>Porticus</hi> (the Porch or Entrance) a Town ſcituate at the Foot of of the Mountain, where hiring an honeſt Countreyman for a true and skilful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and Guide in the way, not without a conſiderable reward, I aſcended the Mountain at midnight through difficult, rough, uneven, and ſteep Paſſages; when I came to the top or mouth I ſaw what is horrible to be expreſſed; I ſaw it all over of a light Fire with a dreadful combuſtion, and ſtench of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and burning <hi>Bitumen;</hi> whereat being aſtoniſhed, methoughts I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the habitation of Hell, wherein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeemed to be wanting but the Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions of Ghoſts, Devils and Damned Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; I then obſerved horrible bellowings and roarings in the Mountain, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible ſtink, ſmoaks mixt with darkiſh Globes of Fire, which both the bottom and ſides of the Mountain continually belched forth from eleven ſeveral places, and made me belch and ready to vomit; <q>O the depth of the riches of the Wiſdom and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:108503:39"/>knowledge of God! How incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible are thy ways! If thou ſheweſt thy power againſt the the wickedneſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in ſuch formidable and potentous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies and Omens of Nature: What ſhall it be in that laſt day wherein the Earth ſhall be deſtroyed by thy wrath, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat?</q> In the morning as ſoon as it was light, that I might with the more diligence ſearch into the Bowels of the Mouutain, I choſe a place to ſet my feet ſecure upon, which was an huge Rock, plain on the top, where taking forth my <hi>Pantometer</hi> (or <hi>Univerſal Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>) I took the dimenſions of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and found by Geometrical Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the compaſs of the Mouth to be almoſt three hundred paces; The Mountain was every where up &amp; down cragged, and broken, yet no gradual declining, for any paſſage to the inward parts, but deſcended in its compaſs of an equal bigneſs like a Well, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the bottom ſeemed narrower, yet I judged it only to proceed from the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great depth and diſtance from our ſight. In the very middle of the bottom Nature ſeemed to have made a Shop or Workhouſe of Fire with everlaſting guſhings forth and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108503:40"/>ſtreamings of Smoak and Flames, which ſeem to be employed for boyling of <hi>Sulphur, Bitumen</hi> and other Minerals in preparation for deadly ruins and ſlaughters afterward to be committed, ſince the Vapours contained therein not having room, endeavoured to free themſelves with ſuch great force and violence, accompanyed with horrible crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and noiſe, that the Mountain ſeems to be toſt with an Earthquake or trembling, upon which the higher and ſofter parts of the Mountain that are clung together of Aſhes, Cinders, Rains and other refuſes of Minerals being ſhook in pieces, and looſned by this quaking, and ſo falling like Hills into the bottom of this Helliſh Gulph, cauſe ſuch terrible noiſes as are often heard, which are ſo great and fearful as may daunt the moſt ſtout and couragious Spirit. The matter which was continually belched forth from the center or bottom of the Mountain made as it were a new Mountain, which had wonderful variety of Furrows or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Channels, with various kinds of melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Minerals, formed as it were by the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Pencil of Nature, ſometimes of a greeniſh colour from <hi>Braſs;</hi> then yellow from <hi>Sulphur, Arſnick,</hi> and <hi>Sandarack;</hi> preſently after Red from <hi>Cinabar, Read

            <p n="44">XLIV. Hear now what our ingenious Countryman Mr. <hi>G. Sandys</hi> relates of this fiery Mountain <hi>Veſuvius,</hi> it is ſcituate in <hi>Campania Faelix,</hi> about eight miles from <hi>Naples,</hi> which City hath received great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and prejudices by its Cinders, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent throwing out of Stones even to its Walls and Houſes; This Mountain has vaſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Fire, and was heretofore high on every ſide before the inward parts were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; it uſually utters ſmoak by day, but by night, Flames; its manner is to ſend forth a loud ſounding or roaring noiſe and bellowing firſt, and then to belch forth a huge quantity of Cinders to the great danger of thoſe who paſs by, but if a vehement wind blow upon it, the Aſhes or Cinders are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo high and driven ſo far in length, that 'tis certain they have ſometimes been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried as far as <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> though many hundred miles diſtance, and ſo affrighted them that they have all ran to their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to implore the averting of Divine Wrath. The Mountain hath a double top, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the North ends in a Plain, the other
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108503:41"/>toward the South aſpires higher, which when covered with Clouds, prognoſticates rain to the <hi>Neopolitans,</hi> in the top there is a large deep hollow in form of an <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theater,</hi> in the midſt is a Pit which leads in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Entrails of the Earth, the matter thrown up is ruddy, light and ſoft, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt brow of the Hill flouriſhes with Trees, and excellent Paſturage, the midſt is ſhaded with Cheſnut Trees and others, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers fruits; The lower parts are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably clothed with Vines which afford the beſt <hi>Greek</hi> Wines in the World; It hath at divers times made dreadful Eruptions and Devaſtations which (as well as Mount <hi>Aet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> of which hereafter) have been accounted ominous, and to portend ſome woful Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities to enſue.</p>
            <p>But never any thing appeared ſo horrible (ſaith my Author) as what hapned in the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Titus</hi> eighty years after Chriſt, For then it diſgorged ſuch boyling Waves and Flouds of Fire as conſumed the Neighbouring Cities; And then it was that <hi>Pliny the Second,</hi> that great ſearcher into Nature, and the famous Author of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Hiſtory, and then Admiral of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Navy, being deſirous to diſcover the reaſon thereof, was choaked and ſuffocated
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108503:41"/>in approaching too near to diſcover ſo great a myſtery of Nature, yet not wilfully I ſuppoſe, though ſome Authors aſſert that he threw himſelf into it, becauſe he could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the natural cauſe of this mighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration; At that time there iſſued forth ſo great a ſmoak that the very Sun ſeemed to be in an Eclipſe, and likewiſe huge Stones, and ſuch plenty of Aſhes, that <hi>Rome, Africk,</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> were even covered with them, and beſides, Beaſts, Fiſh, and Fowl which were deſtroyed, it overwhelmed <hi>Hercula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> and <hi>Pompeios</hi> two adjoyning Cities with Pumice Stones, together with all the People ſitting in the Theater; There were alſo heard diſmal noiſes all about the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and Giants of incredible bigneſs were ſeen to ſtalk up and down the top and ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Mountains (if the Peoples fancies were not impoſed upon by their aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) which extraordinary Accident was judged either a cauſe, or preſage of a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Peſtilence which reigned in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> long after; <hi>Marcellinus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorian relates, That the Aſhes of <hi>Veſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> tranſported in the Air, obſcured and darkned all <hi>Europe,</hi> and that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were wonderfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted therewith, inſomuch that their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror

               <hi>Leo</hi> forſook the City, and that in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of the ſame they celebrated yearly the 12 of <hi>November.</hi> It likewiſe burnt in the ſix year of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Fourth, and groaned, but ejected no Cinders; <hi>Platina,</hi> writes, that it flamed in 685. prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Death of Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> II. with the inſuing Slaughters, Rapines, and Deaths of Princes; During the Papacy of <hi>Benedict</hi> VIII, and IX. it is ſaid to have done the like, and though it hath made dreadful devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet the fruitful Aſhes thrown about did ſeem to repair the foregoing loſſes with a quick and marvellous fruitfulneſs; At the foot of the Hill there are divers holes and vents, out of which exceeding cold wind, do continually iſſue, and which at <hi>Padua</hi> they let into their Rooms at pleaſure, to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie the heat of Summer; In the year 1610. in <hi>February, Veſuvius</hi> began to flame, to the great affrightment of the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> and ſolemn Prayers and Supplications being ordered, they went in Proceſſion with the Head of <hi>Januarius</hi> their Patron, and the defender of their City carried before them; whereby the deluded people were perſuaded that the deſtruction which hung over their heads was prevented. In 1631. was a new

            </p>
            <p n="45">XLV. In the year 1638. likewiſe the induſtrious <hi>Kircher</hi> made a diſcovery of the <hi>Phlegrean,</hi> or Fiery Plains in the Fields of <hi>Puteoli</hi> near <hi>Naples,</hi> which being another wonderful Prodigy of Nature, may be worth relating; Paſſing by <hi>Naples</hi> (ſaith he) I could not let ſlip the opportunity of inquiring and looking into thoſe Sulphurous Plains ſo much celebrated in all Ages; Having therefore gone through a Paſſage under ground, called the <hi>Groote,</hi> arched and made hollow, to the Mountain <hi>Pauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus;</hi> not far from <hi>Puteoli,</hi> between the Jaws of the Mountains, a large Plain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf to view, altogether dreadful and full of horrour, in length about twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot, in breadth a thouſand; The whole Plain is ſurrounded with Hills of high and ſteep Rocks, which were formerly very lofty, but are ſince devoured by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Fires; In the bottom little hills are ſeen to burn and flame, with a ſtrong ſmell of Brimſtone which is carried by the Winds through all the Neighbouring Regions, even as far as <hi>Naples;</hi> ſome parts of the Plain have an infinite number of holes, and are yellow with a Sulphuriſh matter; the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108503:43"/>ground wheh it is touched by thoſe who walk thereon, ſounds and rattles like a Drum by reaſon of the hollowneſs thereof: and you may feel as it were, not without aſtoniſhment, boyling Waters under your feet, and thick fiery fumes to hiſs and flow from one place to another with a great crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling noiſe through the Pipes and Paſſages under ground which are made by theſe fiery Exhalations; the force of this is very great as you may experience by ſtopping any of theſe holes with an heavy ſtone, or the like; for then you ſhall obſerve the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſmoak preſently to throw it up, and belch it forth again; But an huge Laky Ditch in the ſame plain did wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully affect me; It is full of boyling Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, very frightful for their blackneſs, that one would imagine it were a Kettle, or Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron boyling with Pitch and Roſin; It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe admirable that the ſwallowing Gulph caſts forth theſe boyling Waters eight or ten foot above a Mans height, in the faſhion of a ſpire Steeple, or Pyramid; In the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Rocks wherewith this <hi>Vulcanian</hi> Plain is incompaſſed, there are Paſſages like Chimneys, ſome whereof breath out a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Wind, with a terrible ſound and rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and alſo with ſuch ſtrength, that if

            <p n="46">XLVI. In 1650 about five a Clock in the Afternoon in the Countys of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> was a general Earthquake wherewith the People were ſo affrighted, that many of them forſook their Houſes, and ſome Houſes were ſo ſhaken that the Chimneys fell down.

This Iſland was formerly called <hi>Thera,</hi> but now <hi>Santorin,</hi> and ſtarted up out of the Sea, for <hi>Baronius</hi> out of <hi>Pliny</hi> thus writes; In the year 726. a Vapour was ſeen to bubble forth out of a Chimney of Fire, between the Iſlands of <hi>Thereſia,</hi> or <hi>Santorin</hi> from the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108503:44"/>of the Sea, which continued ſome days and the Fire and Smoak growing thicker by degrees, ſpread it ſelf abroad with mighty flames, and with the vaſtneſs of its ſtrength, it caſt out huge Rocky Pumice Stones, and great heaps of other matter, which it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through all <hi>Aſia, Lesbos,</hi> and <hi>Abydus,</hi> and the Sea-Coaſts of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> ſo that the whole Surface of the Sea was covered with theſe Pumices; But in the middle of ſo great a Fire, there was an Iſland made from the heaping up of that matter, and and joyned to the Iſland, called <hi>The Sacred,</hi> which never was in being before; There was likewiſe another Iſland next to this formed in 1670. not without great terror to thoſe of <hi>Santorin;</hi> ſince the burning laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a year, as ſome ancient People who ſaw it with their Eyes did lately teſtifie; But in the middle of this ſmaller new Iſland which is now called little <hi>Camena,</hi> there is to be ſeen at this very day an huge deep Ditch, which being narrow toward the bottom, grows bigger by degrees like a Funnel, out of which as out of a Chimney thoſe mighty Stones and Rocks did burſt forth, which being mixt with Cinders and Aſhes compoſed the reſt of that Iſle.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:108503:44"/>
            <p n="47">XLVII. But if ever theſe Fires pent up in the Bowels of the Earth exerciſed their force, it was moſt remarkable upon <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 24. 1650. which ſhook the Iſland till the ninth of <hi>October,</hi> with ſuch mighty and frequent Earthquakes that the People of <hi>Santorin</hi> fearing that their immediate ruin was approaching, were on their Knees night and day before their Altars; It cannot be expreſſed what an horror invaded all men; eſpecially when thoſe victorious Flames breaking through all Obſtacles, ſtrove to make themſelves a way through the midſt of the Waters of the Ocean about four miles Eaſtward from <hi>Santorin;</hi> For the Sea all on a ſuddain ſwelled Thirty Cubits upward, and extending it ſelf wide through the Neighbouring Lands, overturned all in its way; Inſomuch that it broke in pieces ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ships and Galleys in the very Haven of <hi>Candia,</hi> with its extraordinary violence, though fourſcore miles diſtant from thence; The Air being darkned with thoſe ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſtinking Vapours, put on innumerable Forms and Appearances, as of Fiery Lances, and Swords brandiſhed and ſhaken, bright and glittering Arrows darting forth; Here terrible Serpents and Dragons ſeemed to be flying, There hideous Thunderclaps, Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108503:45"/>and Thunderbolts; And yet they could ſcarce ſee, for the Peoples Eyes were ſo hurt with thoſe ſharp, pricking ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſmoaks, and vapours that almoſt all became blind for three days, with ſuch grievous pains in their Eyes, that they wept continually, and bewailed their moſt miſerable Fate; But when their Eye-ſight returned, they ſaw all their Silver and Gold, both Veſſels and Garments, and Pictures, ſpread over with a yellow colour; and ſuch a vaſt multitude of Pumice ſtones, did this fiery Gulph vomit forth, that it covered the Sea, ſo that they could ſcarce paſs in a Veſſel; It is moſt certain that they were carryed many hundred Miles, even to <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and all the Shoars and Coaſts were filled therewith. The fury of this Burning was greateſt for the firſt two months, which cauſed the Neighbouring Sea to bubble like a boyling Pot, and night and day huge Globes and Flakes of Fire, and exceeding thick Smoak mounted up to the Heavens; which if at any time it was carryed by contrary winds to any places near at hand, beſides a moſt grievous ſtink, it brought certain deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon Birds and Beaſts, yea, upon men themſelves. As it happened in <hi>October</hi> and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108503:45"/>
               <hi>November</hi> this year, that fifty Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men miſerably periſhed thereby, beſides an innumerable multitude of Birds, Sheep, Oxen and Aſſes; The like happened to nine Marriners, who paſſing that way in their Ship by night, after three days were all found half burnt, and were buried in the Iſland <hi>Nio</hi> threeſcore Miles from <hi>Santorin;</hi> But the other four months (for it flamed ſix in all) though that Helliſh Hearth or Furnace abated much of its vigour and fierce heat, and could ſcarce lift it ſelf above the waves, yet it ſtill ſeemed to caſt out Pumice ſtones, and to be labouring to form a new Iſland, which though it does not yet appear above Water, yet in a calm Sea it is obſerved to be very ſhallow thereabout, the Water being in that place not above eight Cubits deep.</p>
            <p n="48">XLVIII. In 1657. The Spaniards felt a terrible blow in <hi>Peru,</hi> which if it were not a Mark of the Wrath of Heaven, (ſaith my Author,) was at leaſt a Sign that the Earth is weary of them, eſpecially in thoſe parts where they have ſtained it with ſo much innocent blood. The City of <hi>Lima</hi> was ſwallowed up by an Earthquake, and <hi>Calao</hi> another City not far from it, was conſumed by a ſhower of Fire out of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108503:46"/>the Clouds, eleven thouſand Spaniards loſt their lives in this calamity, and the Earth devoured an hundred Millions of refined Silver, which the lucre of the Spaniards had forced out of its Bowels. All the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Potoſi</hi> from whence they dug their choiceſt mettal were levelled with the Plain, and no more hopes of Gold was left to their inſatiable avarice.</p>
            <p n="49">XLIX. In 1660 an Earthquake happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and at the ſame time they had news that part of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains had been overthrown ſome days before; They are certain Mountains that divide <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> it did great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief there, overwhelming ſome Medicinal Baths, many Houſes, and deſtroying hundreds of People, only one Church which ſunk into the Caverns below was thrown up again, and ſtands very firm, but in another place. This was looked upon as a great Miracle, eſpecially by the French, who have diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Spaniard about this Church as ſtanding on the Frontier Line, but now is removed near half a League within the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged limits of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="50">L. In 1665. There was a great Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt accompanied with Thunder, Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and an Earthquake in divers places in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108503:46"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> at which time the ſtately Spire of <hi>Trinity-Church</hi> in <hi>Coventry</hi> fell down and demoliſhed a great part of the Church. The next year Sir <hi>Rob.

            <p n="51">LI. In 1668 in Autumn, a great part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſome parts of <hi>Europe</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted with extraordinary Earthquakes; The Cities of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Adriano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> felt its ſad Effects, but not with that violence and continuance as in other Places. In ſome parts of <hi>Perſia</hi> it continued for above fourſcore days; <hi>Torqueto</hi> and <hi>Bolio</hi> two conſiderable Cities, were by its great violence laid even to the ground, and all or moſt of the Inhabitants buried in the Ruins, above ſix thouſand Perſons periſhed in the firſt of them, and above eighteen hundred in the latter; And in all the adjacent Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it raged with extraordinary fury, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108503:47"/>and ruining the Buildings, killing many of the People, and the reſt were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to quit the Towns, and take up their Lodgings in the Fields. About the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1669. there came two Whales and a Grampas up the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> whereof one of the Whales, and the Grampas were killed, and the other Whale which was the bigger, returned back into the Sea.</p>
            <p n="52">LII. In 1669. there happened a moſt dreadful Earthquake and Irruption of Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> of which before I give a particular Account, it may not be unproper to deſcribe the Mountain itſelf, as it has been related by divers famous Hiſtorians; <hi>Aetna</hi> or <hi>Mount Gibello,</hi> called by <hi>Pindar</hi> the <hi>Celeſtial Column</hi> or <hi>Pillar,</hi> is the higheſt Mountain in <hi>Sicily,</hi> from whence all the Iſland may be ſeen at once, and in a clear day the Eye may even reach <hi>Africa;</hi> it rears up its Top or Spire thirty miles into the Sky, and may be ſeen forty or fifty miles at Sea, but its compaſs is ſixty, others ſay an hundred miles ſpace, it appears Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with two ſhoulders, having an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent head in the middle, The lower parts are luxuriouſly fruitful, and the abundance of fat oily matter which is caſt out of it,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108503:47"/>makes the Soil thereof as well as of the whole Iſland Incredibly fruitful in the beſt Wine, Oil, Honey, Saffron, Minerals alſo of Gold, Silver, Silks and Allom, with variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and delicious Fruits, and abundance of all ſorts of Grain, ſo that it was called in old time, <hi>The Granary of the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire;</hi> The middle of the Mountain is woody and ſhady, the upper part rocky, ſteep, and almoſt covered with Snow; yet ſmoaking in the midſt like many conjoyned Chimneys, and vomiting intermitted flames, uſually diſcernable only of a night, as if heat and cold had left their Contentions, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced one another, for though it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally burns, with moſt fervent ſmoak and fire, yet round about the top are ſeen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and moſt deep ſnows, the uppermoſt top is broken and cragged with unſtable Cinders and Pumice ſtones, and cleaves open with a moſt vaſt <hi>Crater</hi> or mouth twelves miles in compaſs, which in a ſteep deſcent ſtreightens it ſelf narrower even to the bottom of Hell as it were; A moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible precipice it is, exceeding formidable with flames and fumes from the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom and ſides of the Mountain, with an horrendous roaring and bellowing not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the burſting forth of Thunders, ſo that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108503:48"/>the very imagination and thoughts of the Fire and Ruins ſo nigh at hand, cannot but at firſt ſight amaze, and afright any humane Creature, and make him ſtart from it, as from the Infernal Gulph of Hell; On one ſide within are moſt dark and dreadful Dens, one whereof is ſo vaſt, as to be capable to contain thirty thouſand Men; In many places you may ſee the tracts and paths of huge Torrents of melted matter; in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry top, Snow and Aſhes, or Cinders, as if they had concluded an Eternal Wedlock, are ſeen to overwhelm all things with a ſad and doleful countenance, which are very dangerous to unwary Viſitors, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them there lye concealed deep holes, and devouring Gulphs, without bottom or end, which have ſwallowed up very many, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unadviſedly too near without a Guide, and by their ruin have left warnings to others not raſhly to venture upon theſe hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den deceits which have cheated mortals of their Lives; in the utmoſt bottom of this Helliſh Gulf the Fire is at no time extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, but always ſends forth either boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat, ſmoak or flame, yet outwardly it begins to grow fierce and terrible only at certain intervals of time more or leſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the combuſtible matter heaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:108503:48"/>and by how much longer it hath ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſo much it burſts forth with greater violence, and together with the Flame ſends forth huge heaps of Sands, and Prodigious Stones of wondrous weight.</p>
            <p n="53">LIII. Theſe Fires have broke forth in ſeveral Ages of the World, to the great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and deſtruction of the Inhabitants, and all the adjacent Countries; As in the year of the World 2600. when the Poſterity of <hi>Janus</hi> went to ſeek new Colonies, they firſt entered <hi>Sicily,</hi> where at that time there was ſo great a burning of the Mountain, that the new Planters leaving the Iſland for fear of Deſplation, went to ſeek new habitations in <hi>Italy;</hi> after them followed the <hi>Sicaneans,</hi> who were likewiſe driven away from theſe Eaſtern Parts, to the Weſtern by theſe dreadful <hi>Aetnean</hi> burnings. In the year 3180. and for above four hundred years after, this Mountain was all on fire with three huge burnings. A little after the Mountains raging anew, it is ſaid to have drawn <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himſelf into the higheſt admiration; Alſo in the Reign of <hi>Hiero,</hi> at which time Hiſtories deliver that <hi>Empedocles</hi> an Obſerver of the Mountain was deſtroyed. In the time of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> about fifty years before Chriſt, <hi>Diodorus</hi> relates, That
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108503:49"/>
               <hi>Aetna,</hi> raged moſt violently, which they ſaid portended the Death of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> It is reported to have been ſo great, that the Sea, with its fervour and boyling heat burnt the very Ships, even as far as the <hi>Vulcanello's</hi> All the Fiſh being deſtroyed and boyled to death; yea within twenty years, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain burnt four times. In the Reign of <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> forty nine years after Chriſt, the Mountain raged ſo, that the Emperor at that time in <hi>Sicily</hi> was ſo affrighted, that he betook himſelf to ſafer ſtations; yet they relate, that the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> out of the greatneſs of his mind did aſcend the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain very far, to conſider more nearly ſuch great Miracles; In ſeveral Ages after, it made woful irruptions, as from the year 1160. to 1169. all <hi>Sicily</hi> was ſhaken with huge Earthquakes, and the Mountain <hi>Aet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> foaming mightily, overthrew all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumjacent places with incredible Deſolation, with the ruin of the Cathedral Church of <hi>Catania</hi> about ten miles diſtant, in which Abbot <hi>John</hi> and his Monks were overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Many other fearful burnings have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſince time, but none more horrible for its mighty devaſtations than that in the year 1669. The Earl of <hi>Winchelſea</hi> late Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in his return
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108503:49"/>from thence, viſiting <hi>Catania,</hi> was an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs of this Prodigious Judgment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he gave the following Account to King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, as ſoon as he came to <hi>Naples.</hi>

                  <p>In my Voyage from <hi>Malta</hi> to this place, I touched at the City of <hi>Catania</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and was there moſt kindly invited by the Biſhop to lodge in his Palace, which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, that ſo I might be the better able to inform your Majeſty of that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Fire which comes from Mount <hi>Gibel,</hi> fifteen miles diſtant from that City; which for its horridneſs in the aſpect, for the vaſt quantity thereof, (for it is fifteen miles in length, and ſeven in breadth) for its monſtrous devaſtation and quick progreſs, may be termed an Inundation of Fire, a Flood of Fire, Cinders and burning Stones, burning with that Rage as to advance into the Sea ſix hundred yards, and that to a mile in breadth, which I ſaw; and that which did augment my admiration was, to ſee in the Sea this matter like ragged Rocks, burning in four fathom Water, two fathom higher than the Sea it ſelf; ſome parts liquid and moving, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, not without great violence, the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108503:50"/>ſtones about it, which like a cruſt of a vaſt bigneſs, and red hot, fell into the Sea every moment, in ſome place or other, cauſing a great and horrible noiſe, ſmoak, and hiſſing in the Sea; and thus more and more coming after it, making a firm foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the Sea it ſelf. I ſtayed there from nine a Clock on Saturday morning, to ſeven next morning, and this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Fire and Stones, with Cinders, had advanced into the Sea twenty yards at leaſt, in ſeveral places; in the middle of this Fire, which burn'd in the Sea, it hath formed a paſſage like to a River, with its Banks on each ſide very ſteep and crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and in this Channel moves the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt quantity of this Fire, which is the moſt liquid, with ſtones of the ſame compoſition, and Cinders all red hot, ſwimming upon the Fire of a great magnitude;</p>
                  <p>From this River of Fire (under the great Maſſe of the Stones which are generally three fathom high all over the Country, where it burns and in other places much more,) there are ſecret Conduits or Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of this liquid matter, which Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate Fire and Heat into all parts more or leſs, and melts the Stones and Cinders by fits in thoſe places where it toucheth them,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108503:50"/>over and over again; where it meets with Rocks or Houſes of the ſame matter (as many are) they melt and go away with the Fire; where they find other compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they turn them to lime or aſhes, as I am informed. The compoſition of this Fire, Stones and Cinders, are Sulphur, Nitre, Quick-ſilver, Sal-Armoniac, Lead, Iron, Braſs, and all other Mettals. It moves not regularly, nor conſtantly down hill; in ſome places it hath made the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys Hills, and the Hills that were not high are now Valleys. When it was night I went upon two Towers in divers places, and could plainly ſee at ten miles diſtance, as we judged, the Fire to begin to run from the Mountain in a direct line, the flame to aſcend as high and as big as one of the higheſt and greateſt Steeples in Your Majeſties Kingdoms, and to throw up great Stones into the Air; I could diſcern the River of Fire to deſcend the Mountain of a terrible fiery or red colour, and ſtones of a paler Red, to ſwim thereon, and to be ſome as big as an ordinary Table. We could ſee this fire to move in ſeveral other places, and all the Country covered with Fire, aſcending with great Flames; in many places, ſmoaking like to a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108503:51"/>furnace of Iron melted, making a noiſe with the great pieces that fell, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe which fell into the Sea. A Cavalier of <hi>Malta,</hi> who lives there, and attended me, told me, that the river was as liquid where it iſſues out of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as water, and came out like a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent with great violence, and is five or ſix fathom deep, and as broad, and that no ſtones do ſink therein. I aſſure Your Majeſty, no Pen can expreſs how terrible it is, nor can all the Art and Induſtry of the World quench, or divert that which is burning in the Country. In forty days time it hath deſtroyed the habitation of twenty ſeven thouſand perſons, made two Hills of one, a thouſand paces high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, and one is four Miles in compaſs.

                  <p>That night which I lay there, it rained Aſhes all over the City, and ten Miles at Sea it troubled my Eyes. This <hi>Fire</hi> in

            <p n="54">LIV. Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> or <hi>Monte Gibello,</hi> a Mountain ſo Renowned throughout the World for its height and greatneſs, but more for thoſe Prodigious Flames, Smoak, and Aſhes which it hath caſt out from the top of it, whilſt the other parts are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally (even in the midſt of Summer) co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Snow, has been for many Ages obſerved once, or ſometimes oftner, in the ſpace of about fifteen years to throw up more than ordinary Flames with much Smoak and Stones, and great quantities of Aſhes; which (though terrible to the Neighbouring Towns and Villages) was yet wont, in little time to abate of its fury, and prove but ſeldom more injurious to the Country near it, than by communicating largely its aſhes, which though for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it did ſomewhat incommode them, they had afterwards a conſiderable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation in the product of their Lands,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108503:52"/>which by this means was rendred more fruitful. But on <hi>Friday</hi> the 18th of <hi>March</hi> 1669. the Sun was obſerved before its ſet-ſetting to appear of a pale and dead colour, which (being contrary to what it ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appeared to us) ſtruck no ſmall terror into the Inhabitants, all Objects appearing alſo of the ſame colour, with a paleneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from that of the Sun: The ſame night happened in this City as well as the whole Countrey hereabouts, a terrible and unuſual Earthquake, whoſe ſtrong and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal motions joyned with horrible Roarings from <hi>Monte Gibello</hi> exceedingly frighted the the Inhabitants, but was ſo extraordinary violent in the Countrey adjacent, that the People were forced to abandon their Houſes, and to fly into the Fields to avoid the danger threatned them from the falling of their Houſes. The Village of <hi>Nicoloſi</hi> was of all others the moſt dreafully handled by this furious Earthquake, the Houſes and other Buildings being ſhaken all in pieces, and buried in their own Ruins; the poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (who had preſerved their Lives by a timely flight, with ſuch little of their goods as their haſty fears would permit them to carry out with them) continued a Night or two in the Fields, beholding with grief
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108503:52"/>and aſtoniſhment the ruin of their habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but obſerving that by theſe violent concuſſions, the Earth began to open in ſeveral places, and to threaten them with inevitable ruin, they fled, though with much trouble and amazement to this City. Theſe ſhakings of the Earth being ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and violent, that the the People went reeling and ſtaggering, with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ſupporting one another from falling, inſomuch as what with their want of ſleep, the pains they were forced to take in travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the great terrors imprinted on them by what they had ſeen and ſuffered, they appeared at their arrival in this City as ſo many deſtracted People wholly inſenſible of what they did.</p>
            <p>This dreadful convulſion of the Earth was immediately followed on <hi>Monday March</hi> 11. about Ten at Night by Three Terrible Eruptions, much about the ſame time, and a little diſtance one from the other.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſaid Eruptions were obſerved to be on the ſide of <hi>Monte Gibello,</hi> about two Miles beyond the Mountain called <hi>Montpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leri,</hi> from whence with a terrible noiſe it threw up its flames with much fury and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence about a hundred yards in height; its
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108503:53"/>noiſe not roaring only inwards from the belly of the Mountain as before, but vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently cracking like peals of Ordinance or Thunder, from the ſide of it, throwing out vaſt ſtones, ſome of them 300, pound weight, which being (as it were) ſhot through the Air, fell ſeveral miles diſtant from the place, whilſt the whole Air was filled with Smoak, burning Cinders, and Aſhes, which fell like a fiery rain upon the Countrey. In the mean time iſſued from the ſide of this Prodigious Mountain a vaſt Torrent of Melted and Burning Matter, which like an Innundation, Drowned, as in a Flood of Fire, the Countrey on this ſide of it. This Burning River ran down upon the Mountain <hi>Mentpileri.</hi> which, oppoſing its direct courſe, it divided it ſelf into two ſtreams, which encompaſſed the ſaid Mountain; one of them taking its way by <hi>La Guardia,</hi> the <hi>Convent</hi> of St. <hi>Ann</hi> and <hi>Malpaſſo:</hi> the other by the Towns of <hi>Montpileri,</hi> and <hi>Falicchi</hi> which in few hours were wholly deſtroyed and loſt, not ſo much as any ſign of them remaining, with ſeveral leſſer Villages and Farmes, and with them the famous Image of the beſſed Lady of the <hi>Annunciata;</hi> which, though highly Reverenced throughout the whole Iſland,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108503:53"/>eſteemed the wonder of <hi>Sicily</hi> and the whole World; and to which the People with much Devotion reſorted in Pilgrimage from the remoteſt parts, was alſo ſwallowed up and conſumed by this dreadful Torrent.</p>
            <p>This Fiery and Burning Deluge imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſpread it ſelf to above ſix Mile in breath, ſeeming to be ſomewhat of the colour of melted and burning Glaſs; but, as it cools, becomes hard and Rocky, and every where in its paſſage leaves Hills and Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids of that matter behind it.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time <hi>Monte Gibello</hi> from its top raged with dreadful Flames, which with its noiſe and Concuſſions of the Earth which ſtill continued, added not a little to the Terror of the People, who ran with Cries and Lamentations about the City and Country, expecting nothing but to be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up or conſumed by Fire, having no other apprehenſions but of Death, and a General Conflagration. The two Torrents of Fire came forward, deſtroying all things in their way, and by <hi>Wedneſday, March</hi> 13th. had on the Weſt ſide branched it ſelf into ſeveral Streams, and over-ran <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po Rotundo,</hi> St. <hi>Pietro,</hi> and <hi>Moſtorbianco,</hi> with <hi>La Potielli,</hi> and Sr. <hi>Antonino;</hi> and on the Eaſt-part rain'd the lower part of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:108503:54"/>
               <hi>Maſcalucia,</hi> and <hi>Le Placchi,</hi> taking its way towards this City.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 14th, the Wind came Eaſtwards, on which fell abundance of Rain, which abated not the Progreſs of the Fire; which on the Eaſt-ſide had from <hi>Maſcalucia</hi> made its way to St. <hi>Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni di Galermo,</hi> the lower part whereof it deſtroyed; and paſſing on, ſeemed to threaten this City on one ſide, as did that on the Weſt-ſide the other. As the Fire approached, the Religious every where appeared with much Devotion, carrying in Proceſſion their Reliques, eſpecally thoſe of St. <hi>Agatha,</hi> the famous Martyr of <hi>Catania,</hi> in which they repoſed no ſmall confidence, followed by great multitudes of People, ſome of them mortifying themſelves with Whips, and other ſigns of Penance, with great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Cryes, expreſſing their dreadful expectation of the Events of thoſe Prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fiery Inundations.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the People were thus buſied in their Devotions, and aſtoniſht by their Fears, News was brought to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of the City, that a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Thiefs and Robbers had taken the opportunity of this general deſtraction, to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108503:54"/>make a Prey of the already diſtreſſed Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that they had murdered ſeveral of them for their Goods; and that it was to be fear'd, that the City of <hi>Catania</hi> it ſelf, might run ſome danger from the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them which were about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and from thence took their opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to get into the Town. Whereupon, Conſultation being had for the prevention of farther miſchief from them, the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Caſtle was ordered with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of Horſe, and a Party of Spaniards, to ſecure the Countrey and City againſt theſe Robbers; who immediately ſent out ſeveral Parties with his Provoſt-Marſhal, with Order to ſeize upon all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Perſons, and ſuch as were not able to give a good account of themſelves: And for ſuch as were taken in the Fact Robbing, to Execute them by Martial-Law, without any farther Tryal; and accordingly cauſed three pair of Gallowes to be ſet up for their ſpeedy Execution; one before the Gate <hi>Di Aci,</hi> a ſecond in the <hi>Market-place,</hi> and a third before the Gate <hi>Della Decima,</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtrong Guards upon the Gates of the City, and cauſing all ſuſpected Houſes to be ſearched, an Account to be given in of all Lodgers, and ſuch Perſons to be ſecured
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108503:55"/>as could any ways fall under a Suſpition. The poor People out of the Countrey being by this Prodigious Calamity ſtript out of all their Eſtates, and reduced to great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, fled moſt of them for refuge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to this City, with great Lamentations, moving the Charity of the Magiſtrates, who were readily inclined to give them the beſt aſſiſtance they were able; and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens moved by their Complaints and Sufferings, freely open'd their Doors, filling their Houſes with as many of thoſe diſtreſſed People as they could poſſibly receive; the Biſhop and all Perſons of Quality and Eſtate, contributing largely for their ſupport, till better Order could be taken for the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Meſſina</hi> alſo, and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities (informed of this extraordinary Calamity) ſent hither large Supplies of Proviſions offering their beſt aſſiſtance to this place, in caſe of extremity. All the Elements ſeemed at this time to make War upon us, and to conſpire together for the puniſhment of the Inhabitants; The Air was continually darkned with Clouds and Smoak, agitated by great and violent Winds, and oftentimes ſhowred down great Rains, inſomuch as the Sun from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108503:55"/>of theſe Eruptions, very ſeldom appeared to us, and when it did, (with extraordinary paleneſs,) for a little time only and (as it were abhorring ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Spectacle) ſoon hid its face again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a thick Cloud.</p>
            <p>The Sea ran much higher than it was wont to do, and by its extraordinary Roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in ſome places overflowing its Banks, added not a little to our Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Land every where infeſted with Thieves, inſomuch, that till by the extraordinary care taken by the Magiſtrates and Officers, ſevere execution was done upon ſuch as were apprehended in the Fact, no perſon was able to ſtir abroad without danger of his Life; whilſt the Fire by this prodigious overflowing of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, threatned to take poſſeſſion of all.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the 15th. the ſtream of fiery Matter which deſtroyed the lower part of St. <hi>Giovanni di Galermo</hi> divided it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parts, one of its branches taking its way toward <hi>Moſterbianco,</hi> the other threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the City of <hi>Catania,</hi> but this laſt was obſerved to move with more ſlowneſs than before, having in 24 hours time ſcarcely gained 20 paces.</p>
            <pb n="106" facs="tcp:108503:56"/>
            <p>On the 18th. being <hi>Monday,</hi> the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents being ſtill ſeen to draw nearer and nearer to this City, the Senate with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſegnior <hi>Cambuchi</hi> the Biſhop of this place, followed by all the Clergy Secular and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and an infinite number of People went in a ſolemn Proceſſion out of this City to <hi>Monte de St. Sofia,</hi> carrying out with greateſt Devotion their choiceſt Relicks, and upon an Altar erected in view of the Mountain, expoſed them, where they cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Maſs and uſed the Exorciſmes accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed upon ſuch extraordinary occaſions, all which time, the Mountain ceaſed not as before with exceſſive roaring to throw up its Smoak and Flames with extraordinary violence, and and abundance of great ſtones; which were carried through the Air, ſome of them falling within their view, though at ten miles diſtance from the Eruption; the Aſhes which proceeded from thence were ſcattered in great abundance, as well on this City as on the Country adjacent, every where in the Fields with Cinders, and the heat of the ſaid Aſhes deſtroying the Graſs, which obliged the People to drive away their Cattel to a farther diſtance, which would otherwiſe have periſhed for want of food.</p>
            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:108503:56"/>
            <p>Theſe ſtreams of ruin daily crept nearer and nearer to this City, but by uneven and irregular motions, according as it was more or leſs ſupplyed from its fountain; but on <hi>We dneſday</hi> the twentieth we perceived that that branch of it which ſeemed moſt to threaten this City from St. <hi>Giovanni di Galermo</hi> was wholly extinguiſht, and the other which bent its courſe toward <hi>Moſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bianco</hi> ran but ſlowly, and gave us ſome hopes that its fury was alſo near ſpent, but the other Torrent which had before over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown <hi>Moſterbianco,</hi> continued its motion with as much violence as ever, being in breath above a Muſquet ſhot over; but in probability could not eaſily overflow to the Weſtward which was defended by its Rocky ſcituation; another branch which ran by <hi>Santo Pietro</hi> was obſerved to be much larger than the reſt, and its ſtream more quick and active, but meeting with ſome oppoſition in its way, it made ſome ſtop, only ſending out a Rivulet toward the Eaſtwards about three or four yards wide, of its moſt ſubtle or active matter, which directed its courſe towards a ſmall Village about a Furlong diſtant from its main ſtream; another Branch threatned <hi>Campo Rotundo,</hi> but bent its courſe Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108503:57"/>towards the Farm of <hi>Valcorrente,</hi> where its Fiery body was ſcattered into ſeveral deep and rocky places, without any conſiderable damage.</p>
            <p>About this time we had hopes that the violence of this Eruption had been over, the Mountain not throwing out its flames with that violence as before, and its noiſe and roaring in a great meaſure ceaſed.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who at neareſt diſtance took a view of the Mountain, informed that the top of it, was fallen in, and the Mountain ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to want near a Mile of its former heighth; that the largeſt of the Mouths from whence theſe fiery ſtreams were vented, was about half a mile in compaſs; but the view of this dreadful Inundation carried ſo much terror in it as they were not able to expreſs; from all theſe Mouths were vomited Rivers of a thick and fiery ſubſtance of ſtone and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals melted, whoſe depth was various accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeveral places it filled in its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, in ſome places four, in others eight, twelve or fifteen yards and upwards; its breadth in ſome places ſix miles, in others much more; its flame like that of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and its motion like that of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver; advancing ordinarily very ſlowly, unleſs where it was provoked by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108503:57"/>of a freſh Torrent or ſome conſiderable deſcent. Whereſoever it paſſed, it left large heaps of its congealed matter, with which it covered and burnt the Earth, melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Walls of Ciſtles and Houſes, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down and conſuming all before it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being yet found able to reſiſt its force, nor any thing able to quench its burning, water being obſerved rather to add to its fury; whereſoever it has paſſed, it has left its dreadful marks behind it, levelling ſome hills and raiſing others, ſo much changing the ſcituation, that not the leaſt trace of any Place or Town remains, nothing being to be ſeen but confuſed heaps of ragged ſtone, which yielding a noiſome fume, ſtrikes terror and aſtoniſhment into all that behold it.</p>
            <p>On Friday the 22. the Mountain again roared with much loudneſs, and threw up from its Mouth a vaſt quantity of matter, which formed two large hills higher and larger than that of <hi>Menpileri,</hi> with a large bank of the ſame matter to the Eaſtward, ſending down a violent ſtream of its liquid matter towards <hi>Malpaſſo,</hi> much enlarging the former Current, and paſſing thence to <hi>Campo Rotundo</hi> and <hi>Santo Pietro</hi> compleated the ruines of thoſe Towns, driving furiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:108503:58"/>towards <hi>Moſterbianco;</hi> the other ſtream by <hi>Santo Giovanni de Galermo</hi> being wholly diverted and extinguiſht. From this time till the 25th, the Mountain continued ſilent, but then it burſt out again with more force than ever before, its noiſe much louder, like Peales of Ordnance, and ſo forcible and laſting, as for twenty four hours it cauſed a ſhaking and trembling in our Buildings, the Air ſo filled with Smoak and Aſhes, as darkned the Face of the Sky. The Birds and Fowl about this time, either through want of Food, or illneſs of Air, which was corrupted with the noiſome ſmells ariſing from theſe Burnings, were obſerved to lye dead in all places.</p>
            <p>On the 28th. the Grand Current was advanced near the City as far as the old <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins,</hi> which ſtruck ſo great a Terror into the People, that moſt of them left the City, only ſome Officers remaining with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as were under their command, who have ſecured and ſent away the <hi>Magazine,</hi> and all the Artillery from the Caſtle.</p>
            <p n="55">LV. A Latter Relation from <hi>Catania,</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 27. gives this further Account, The dreadful Inundation from <hi>Monte Gibello</hi> having deſtroyed many <hi>Caſtles</hi> and <hi>Towns,</hi> with an infinite loſs, and utter ruin to the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:108503:58"/>Inhabitants, arrived lately with a renewed Force at <hi>Moſtor-bianco,</hi> which it has wholly ruin'd, from thence paſſing on to <hi>Albanelli,</hi> in four days ſpace deſtroyed all the Gardens and Vineyards with ſixty three thouſand Vines. On <hi>Wedneſday April</hi> 16. With an Impetuous Fiery Torrent it came towards <hi>Sardanello,</hi> where all the remainder of the Inhabitants of this City were Spectators of it, which reſembled a River of melted and burning Braſs, about ten Ells wide, running with ſwiftneſs to the Arch of <hi>Marcus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> a famous Piece of Antiquity, and paſſing under it, ruin'd about ſix Ells of it, which was the breadth of the Current in that place: from thence it ran to <hi>Madonni di Monſerrato,</hi> which it wholly deſtroyed: then falling down to <hi>Madonna delle Gratie,</hi> it entred in at one Gate, and paſſed through another, without any conſiderable hurt, and running through the Gate <hi>Della Decima,</hi> filled all the Plain <hi>Di Schiara Viva,</hi> where it was above ſix Ells deep. Then taking its way towards the Bulwark, on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, under the Caſtle of this City, it ran by, two Ells deep into the Sea; in which, (to the great wonder of all that ſaw it) it has made its Progreſs a mile in length, and as much in breadth, and is drawing towards
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108503:59"/>the Gate of the Channel, which gives us great Apprehenſions, leaſt it may that way Invade the City it ſelf: Nor is there leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on the ſide <hi>Del Tindaro,</hi> where there runs a great Torrent of the ſame Active matter, which draws near, and ſeems to threaten the Walls, and is in that place about a mild in breadth, having overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſtroyed all the Gardens, from the Gate <hi>Della Decima,</hi> as far as <hi>Madonni delli Amellati.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The names of the moſt conſiderable Towns and places ruined and deſtroyed by the dreadful Earthquakes and Irruptions were, The Town of <hi>Nicoloſi,</hi> wholly ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Badara</hi> and <hi>Tre Caſtagne</hi> the greateſt part deſtroyed; The Towns of <hi>La Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, Malpaſſo, Campo Rotundo, Potielli,</hi> St. <hi>Antonino.</hi> St. <hi>Pietro, Maſterbianco, Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pileri, La Anunciata, Falicchi, Placchi,</hi> all wholly overflowed conſumed, and loſt in this fiery Inundation with all the Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them, no foot-ſteps of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining; The Towns of <hi>Maſculucia,</hi> and St. <hi>Giovanni de Galermo</hi> ruined in part; The large Gardens and Vineyards of <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelli</hi> overflown and deſtroyed: The famous piece of Antiquity of <hi>Marcus Marcellus,</hi> much ruined; <hi>Madonna de Monferrato</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108503:60"/>Jaws of Hell it ſelf; The aforenamed <hi>Kircher</hi> made Obſervation of this Mountain likewiſe, which he thus relates; That on a certain day viewing <hi>Strombolo</hi> very curiouſly, about threeſcore miles diſtant, he obſerved it to be more than ordinarily furious, for it appeared wholly overwhelmed with Fire in ſo great plenty, that it ſeemed to belch out flaming Mountains, a moſt horrendous Spectacle; And then, ſaith he, I heard a ſtrange kind of dull murmur from the Mountain ſo far off, which ſeemed to come towards us under the Earth, till it reached the ſubterrancous place where we ſtood, and there uttered ſuch horrible Thundrings within the Earth, with ſuch formidable Earthquakes, that none of them were able to ſtand on their Feet; After the violence was over, getting up again with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Conſternation, they beheld the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and lamentable ſubverſion of the famous Town of St <hi>Euphemia</hi> three miles off, which happened at that inſtant, the City being wholly ſwallowed up, for ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Town, they found inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, what is wonderful to be related, nothing but a dark ſtinking Lake ſprung up in its place, they could find no men nor Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; Thence paſſing on their Journey,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108503:60"/>they found nothing elſe for Two Hundred miles, but the Carcaſes of Cities, horrid ruins of Caſtles, Men ſtragling up and down in the open Fields, and through hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and famine pining and withering away.</p>
            <p n="57">LVII. In <hi>April</hi> 1669. The Mountain <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuvius</hi> aforementioned caſt up more Smoak and Aſhes than formerly, and for ſeveral Nights the neighbouring places were much affrighted with the great Flames which iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it, accompanied with unuſual noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; At the ſame time they write, That the Vice-Roy of <hi>Sicily</hi> having compaſſion upon the miſerable condition of above thirty thouſand poor People, who by their Flight had ſaved themſelves from the Fire of Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> aforementioned, which had deſtroyed ſeventeen or eighteen Towns or Villages, and by the daily approaches to the City of <hi>Catania,</hi> ſeemed to threaten it with inevitable ruine, ſo that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans were leaving the place; And that he thereupon ſent one of his Officers to take order for the maintenance of thoſe diſtreſſed Creatures, and diſpoſing of them into pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſafety. <hi>June</hi> 20. this year at <hi>Jnſpurg</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> a little after Noon, there was a very violent Tempeſt with extraordinary
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:108503:61"/>Hail, Rain, Thunder and Lightning, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an Earthquake, which had ſuch terrible Effects at <hi>Schnatz</hi> a Town about three miles diſtant from <hi>Jnſpurg,</hi> where the Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> had ſome Silver Mines, that the River which runs through it overflowing, drowned all the adjacent Fields, driving down, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above thirty Houſes, endamaging many more, and drowning above two hundred People.</p>
            <p n="58">LVIII. In 1682. <hi>Aug.</hi> 25. The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Veſuvius</hi> did caſt out Fire accompanied with a moſt terrible and hideous noiſe, which from an hour after Sunſet on Saturday, till three a Clock next morning was ſo great, that it cauſed a kind of Earthquake, the houſes in that City being plainly obſerved to ſhake; The Mountain likewiſe caſt out Aſhes in great abundance, which were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed many miles by the Wind, and the Sunday, all the Streets of <hi>Naples</hi> were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with them, as if it had been a deep Snow. Theſe Prodigies very much terrified the People, and Publick Prayers were made for appeaſing the Wrath of Heaven; It is added, That many great Coals of Fire fell alſo, the dread whereof wrought ſo much upon the Inhabitants, that they removed to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:108503:61"/>other Cities; That the terrible Earthquakes have thrown down near three thouſand Buildings all about the foot of the Mountain, and it roared ſo loud as to be heard forty miles diſtance in a ſtill night. The ſame year an Earthquake happened in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> which affected all the Cities and places for many hundred miles about.</p>
            <p n="59">LIX. In 1685. a very wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy happened in <hi>France,</hi> which though it may not ſeem ſo properly inſerted among theſe Relations of Earthquakes, yet the ſtrangeneſs and reality thereof, may excuſe the account I ſhall give of it; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally known may be the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. It is notorious to all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that the French King, after a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Infractions of his moſt ſolemn Edicts, Oaths and Proteſtations for ſecuring to the Proteſtants of his Kingdom the free exerciſe of their Religion, began about the year 1684. openly and without the leaſt provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to uſe all manner of Cruelties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, to oblige them if poſſible to renounce their Faith and Profeſſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, <q>That he would no longer ſuffer any Proteſtants in his Kingdom, but that they muſt reſolve either to change their Religion or elſe to ſuffer the utmoſt Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:108503:62"/>that could be inflicted upon them.</q> In proſecution of this inhumane reſolution, Dragoons were imploy'd, firſt to ſeize the Goods of thoſe that continued conſtant in their Religion, after which they proceeded to further cruelties, hanging ſome Men and Women up by the Hair of the Head or the Feet within their own Chimneys, ſmoaking them with Wiſps of Wet Straw; Others they threw into the Fire, and pluckt them thence half roaſted; They tied them on the Rack, and poured Wine down their Throats till the ſame had deprived them of their reaſon, and then made them ſay, They would be Catholicks. They ſtript them ſtark naked and Larded them all over with Pins from Head to Foot. They kept them from ſleeping ſeven or eight days and nights together. They tied Parents to Bed-poſts and raviſhed their Daughters before their Eyes. They pluckt off the Nails from the Hands and Toes of others, with moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable pains, and after theſe and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other indignities, if they ſtill refuſed to abjure the Truth, they threw them into cloſe, dark, and ſtinking Dungeons, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing upon them all manner of Barbarities. Their Miniſters were baniſhed, their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es demoliſhed, their Houſes pluckt down

            <p>Among the baniſhed Miniſters was the famous Monſieur <hi>Jurieu,</hi> who retiring into <hi>Holland,</hi> writ ſeveral Paſtoral Letters to the Poor Perſecuted Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> for the ſtrengthening and confirming them in the True Faith of Chriſt, and for reducing thoſe who through fear of trouble and danger had ſeemingly reconciled themſelves to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church, and were afterward termed <hi>New Converts.</hi> In one of theſe Letters Monſieur <hi>Jurieu</hi> gives a very ſurprizing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Songs and Voices which were heard in the Air, the year 1685. of which I ſhall give an account in his own words.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtorians of all Ages have been of opinion that the great Revolutions which have happened in the Societies of men have been preceded by the extraordinary Events, ſuch as Earthquakes, Signs in Heaven, and Prodigies on Earth, of which I could give an infinite number of matters of Fact, very well atteſted, which have been Preſages of Events little leſs conſiderable than thoſe at preſent in the World; and though it ſeems to me that Earthquakes have their Natural Cauſes, and ſo have Famines Peſtilences and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:108503:63"/>Wars; nevertheleſs Jeſus Chriſt puts theſe among thoſe things which are to preſage his coming; Not that I believe all Ecclipſes and all Earthqukes are Preſages, but there are ſuch circumſtances of time and place and concomitant ſigns in ſome, that no man I think without raſhneſs can deny but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God doth diſpenſe them to ſtrike the minds of Men with aſtoniſhment, and make them attentive to his Judgments; and among other times this year 1685 has been as abundant in Prodigies as any for a long while; wherein we have heard of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but extraordinary Storms, Fires fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from Heaven, others coming out of the Earth, of Signs in the Air, and Inſects of unknown ſhaps which have been believed to have fallen from Heaven; And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Singing of Pſalms and Voices in the Air.</p>
            <p>It is near a year ſince we firſt heard any Speech concerning it, and they told us that theſe Singings had been heard in <hi>Bearns,</hi> the firſt Province whether the Dragoons were ſent. Behold our Witneſſes, every one will judge of what worth they are Monſieure <hi>Magendy</hi> Paſtor of the Church of <hi>Orthez</hi> having been queſtioned concerning this Affair has interrogated divers Perſons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it appears by his Cirtificate.</p>

                     <p>I do declare that Moſieure <hi>Bazin</hi> a younger Brother, and an Inhabitant of <hi>Orthez</hi> in <hi>Bearne</hi> hath told me, that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſome of his Friends after mid-day near the City of <hi>Orthez,</hi> he heard voices which Sung Pſalms; and as he imagined that it might be ſome Women that waſht Linnen, he ran to demand of them whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was they that Sung; they told him no, and that they themſelves had for a long time heard the ſame Singing of Pſalms. This happened ſome Months before the Interdiction of our Church. The ſaid Monſieur <hi>Bazin</hi> is a very honeſt man, very judicious, and of integrity; I add that <hi>Mademoiſſelle de Caſenaue</hi> of <hi>Orthez</hi> ſaid to Perſons worthy of credit, That being not able to believe that which was ſaid concerning this Singing of Pſalms, a Woman ſayd to her, That if She had the curioſity to hear them Sing, She would call on her at her own Houſe at a time convenient, which ſhe did; for this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being at a eleven at night in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt part of the City, with multitudes of other Perſons, to hear theſe voices which Sung in the Air the Praiſes of God; having heard this ſinging of Pſalms, She ran to <hi>Mademoiſelle Caſenaue,</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:108503:64"/>gets out of her Bed, cauſes one of her Neighbours to riſe; and they ran to that quarter of the City which was far removed from her Houſe, where they found multitudes of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were raviſhed with that pleaſant me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody which they heard in the Air; they themſelves return'd to their Houſes with this great conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have heard thoſe Pſalms Sung in the Air which they could no more Sing in their Church, which had been interdicted for ſome months paſt: They added, That they ſeemed to hear them Sing after the ſame manner which they uſed to Sing in their Church, and after the Singing ceaſed, there was a Voice which ſpake but after a manner inarticulate and confuſed, ſo that they could not diſtinguiſh what was ſaid. This Gentlewoman is very well worthy of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Moreover I atteſt that an infinite number of Perſons of <hi>Orthez</hi> do ſay, that they heard the Singing of Pſalms, which they call the Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Angels; and that they exhorted each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the day to be preſent in the night in certain places of the City to ſatisfie this Holy Curioſity, which was the reaſon that the Magiſtrates of <hi>Orthez</hi> publiſhed an Ordinance, whereby they forbad all Perſons from going out of their Houſes, or aſſembling themſelves by night to hear theſe Voices; which filled this poor afflicted People with joy, and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſolation. This is that which has heen told me concerning this Singing of Pſalms, to which I find no difficulty to give a full conſent becauſe the Perſons that have reported it are of great ſincerity.</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:108503:67"/>were many Perſons that heard the ſinging of Pſalms in the City of <hi>Orthez.</hi> The firſt that heard it was <hi>Lichagaray Brunier</hi> a Lawyer, revolted ſome years ſince, the moſt malignant of the Perſecutors, and who continually ſtir'd up troubles to thoſe of the reformed Religion. He roſe from his Bed to tell the Curate that there was an Aſſembly of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who ſung Pſalms without the City. He alſo went to a Serjeant named <hi>Gowlan</hi> to conduct him to the place where he thought to ſurprize them, but this Popiſh Serjeant having laid his Ear to the Window, ſaid there was nothing to be done, for he plainly perceived the ſinging was in the Air. Afterward it was often heard for above a month by divers Perſons, both by night and day, Among others M. <hi>Canneille</hi> an Elder of the Church of <hi>Orthez</hi> proteſted to me that ſitting reading on the Rivers Bank about a mile from the City, he heard a great ſinging of Pſalms on that ſide the Church ſtands, which is in the midſt of the City, and not at all doubting but it was an ordinary Aſſembly met together to Evening Prayers, which was then very numerous becauſe of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous conjuncture, and conſiſted at the leaſt of two or three thouſand Souls, he haſtned thither, and heard a great ſinging of Pſalms all along till he was entered into the City, but finding the Doors ſhut, the Neighbours told him that it was not yet the hour of Prayer. It is to no purpoſe to alledge that they ſung in ſome Cavern or Cave, for there is nothing but Houſes, Vineyards, Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and Fields thereabout, and the ſtrict prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition againſt the Proteſtants ſinging of Pſalms, under very ſevere penalties, makes it highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable. Moreover this Elder told me that he never heard more lofty ſinging in the Church.</q>

               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:108503:69"/>This Monſieur <hi>Braſſalay</hi> declared as a moſt certain truth in the preſence of many honeſt men.</p>
            <p>After the Church of <hi>Orthez</hi> was razed to the Ground this ſinging ceaſed till about <hi>October</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and then was again heard by moſt of that City, and by many that came out of the Countrey to Market and ſtaid till night on purpoſe. It ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily happened about the ſame hour, between eight and nine at night, ſome heard the words o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Tune of the Pſalm, and there is ſcarce a Houſe in <hi>Orthez</hi> of which ſome of the Family hath not heard it. Monſieur <hi>Brunier</hi> aforementioned went one night with two or three others to the uſually place without the City, and they all three heard the ſinging for a long time over their heads the Tune of the 138 Pſalm, whereof they could hear diſtinctly theſe words.</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <l>Toward thy Holy Temple I</l>
                  <l>Will look and worſhip thee,</l>
                  <l>And praiſed with my thankful voice</l>
                  <l>Thy Holy name ſhall be.</l>
                  <l>Even for thy loving kindneſs ſake,</l>
                  <l>And for thy Truth withal,</l>
                  <l>For thou thy Name haſt by thy Word</l>
                  <l>Advanced over all.</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Faur</hi> a Phyſitian and Magiſtrate of the City another Papiſt, heard it divers times, but their malice made them ſay they were Sorcerers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. A young Damſel of <hi>Moncade</hi> heard this ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being in her Bed; She aroſe and cauſed above 50 perſons to go out, who having heard it, fell on their Knees, and wept through the joy they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to hear ſuch incomparable melody in the Air, which continued above half an hour. The place of this ſinging was raiſed above the City, even as a very high Mountain, and the People
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:108503:69"/>heard this ſinging over their heads, as if it had been in the Clouds. I have heard an honeſt man make this Relation, who poured out tears when he ſpake of it. The ſame thing I heard from other places. To conclude it is impoſſible to doubt of a truth which the far greateſt part of the Inhabitants of <hi>Orthez</hi> are able to certify. And to which the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Bearn</hi> have alſo given their Teſtimony by a Decree which forbids men to go hear theſe Pſalms, or to ſay they have heard it on the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of 500 Crowns, and the Conſuls of <hi>Orthez</hi> publiſhed theſe Ordinances in their City.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing hath happened in <hi>Cevennes.</hi> As this Countrey is full of Mountains where there are Eccho's which multiply and return the voice, and as Night Aſſemblies have continually been made there, where they ſing Pſalms with aloud voice, therefore the relations of ſingings may ſeem the more doubtful. But the Affair of <hi>Orthez</hi> which is a Countrey cloſe and without Mountains being well proved, I ſee no reaſon (ſaith Monſieur <hi>Juvieu</hi>) to queſtion that of <hi>Cevennes,</hi> and ſhall therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcruple produce the Certificates which come from that Country.</p>
            <p>The firſt runs thus.

            <p>The fourth Certificate is the Extracts of two Letters written to <hi>Lanſunna</hi> to <hi>Mademoiſelle Louiſe des Vignoles,</hi> by her Couſin <hi>M. Jane des Vignoles.</hi> Dated <hi>Jan.</hi> 3. 1686.

<q>How happy are you my dear Couſin that you can Pray and Sing the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God in Publick, when in the mean time ſo many good Souls have their Souls ſtopped, and dare not diſcover what paſſes in their mind; But as to the Buſineſs of Singing the Praiſes of God, it is neceſſary that I ſpeake to you of the Miracle which makes ſo much noiſe in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which is that ſince the entire loſs of our Churches and our Paſtors, there has been heard in the Air Voices and Sounds of Inſtruments very melodious, and that which is moſt extraordinary is, that many Perſons diſtinguiſh the Tunes of the Pſalms; and I can aſſure you of the truth thereof, ſince I my ſelf have diſtinguiſhed more than thirty; It has been told me that my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (M. <hi>de Mont Vaillant</hi>) diſtinguiſhes them all perfectly well. Can you imagine that we hear theſe Voices Night and Day, and that we can ſo much as doubt that they are Troops of Angels which God ſends to us for our conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to aſſure us that he hath not utterly forſaken us, and that our deliverance is at hand; God grant that we may make profit by theſe things. I had forgotten to tell you that the noiſe of a Drum is here heard ſo clearly that no Body can doubt thereof, no more then about the Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pſalms; for there are ſo many Perſons of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:108503:71"/>good underſtandings convinced thereof, that we ought to give up our ſelves to the power of Truth. I do avow that the thing paſſes all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, but be aſſured that all care imaginable has been taken to prevent deluſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, ſaith my Author, how ought we diſtreſſed Proteſtants to give thanks to God that he approves our Worſhip by a ſign ſo conſiderable? Let not our Enemies tell us that all this is nothing but deluſion, for all Illuſions come from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lies, and who hath the Praiſes of God in in horror and deteſtation; In ſhort, behold this Event as a happy Preſageope, God will not ſuffer our Voices nor our. Songs to die: The Angels have taken them up, and will ſhortly reſtore them that we our ſelves made ſound them forth in the Air: The time of our deliverance is at hand, and the Spirit of Life will return, when the Spirit of Repentance and Piety is re-entred into our Souls.</p>
            <p n="60">LX. In 1687. <hi>Octob.</hi> 20. The <hi>London Gazett</hi> gives a ſad Relation of another Earthquake in the Kingdom of <hi>Peru</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> whereby the City of <hi>Lima</hi> was totally overthrown, and not one Houſe left ſtanding, burying many of the Inhabitants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its ruins; At the ſame time <hi>Callao, Fanette, Piſco, Chancay, Los Florillos,</hi> &amp;c. Moſt of them Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Towns were deſtroyed by an Inundation of the Sea, which carried ſeveral Ships above nine Miles into the Countrey; and great numbers of People and Cattel were drowned, there being found when the water fell, at one place near the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide above five thouſand People, dead, and every dry more were found; ſo that no account could be given of their number.</p>
            <p n="61">LXI. In 1688. A dreadful Earthquake hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at <hi>Naples</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which was attended with
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:108503:72"/>the rage and roarings of Mount <hi>Veſuvius;</hi> of which the <hi>London Gazett</hi> gives likewiſe the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inwing Account in a Letter from that City; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>June</hi> 8, On <hi>Saturday June,</hi> 5. about the twenty ſecond hour happened here a terrible Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, though it laſted not long, which fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Inhabitants out of their Houſes with the terror of an inevitable deſtruction, they betook themſelves to the Plazza's and open publick pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the City. The old College of the Jeſuits was ruin'd by it, alſo the great Chappel of their New Colledge, together with three other Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels adjoining, Three of the Fathers were killed there, beſides manneſs hers whoſe numbers are not yet known: The Front of another great Church of the Jeſuits opened in many cracks, and the great Tower or Steeple ſeemed ready to fall. In the <hi>Theatins</hi> Convent of the Holy Apoſtles, a whole Dormitory fell down, beſides other conſiderable damage they received: And the magnificent Arch erected before the Church of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſaid Fathers fell, together with thoſe great and ancient Columns that formerly made part of the Temple <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux;</hi> there there remaining only four of them ſtanding, and thoſe in a tottering condition; Out of theſe ruins there have been already dug 19. Perſons that were dead, and there was reaſon to fear that the miſchief might have been much greater, it being ſo near to a publick Market where there were great throngs of People. The Walls of the great Church of St. <hi>Dominick</hi> opened in many places; and great part of the Refectory fell down, as alſo part of adjoyning Palace, where many were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; ſeveral other Churches of <hi>Auguſtins,</hi> &amp;c. were ruined; and in ſhort there is ſcarce a Palace or
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:108503:72"/>Houſe that has not received ſome conſiderable damage. This occaſioned very devout Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Perſons of all Ranks. The next day was another great Shock which threw down many of the Houſes that were before the moſt weakned; and Yeſterday there was another perceived, but without much damage; but this day we have felt nothing of it; However the Proceſſions continue in great numbers, and the Perſons of Quality are all retired from hence. In the Neighbourhood of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dico,</hi> a City ſixteen Miles diſtant from hence, a mountain opened, and a Courier from <hi>Benevento</hi> a City belonging to the Pope, brings an Account that it was all ruined, and that of Six thouſand Inhabitants there were but few left alive; The Arch-biſhops Palace there was thrown down, and the Arch-biſhop himſelf drawn out of the ruins, being hurt in his Head and Arm. And there are Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the like damages in ſeveral other places.</p>
            <p>In a Letter from <hi>Rome June</hi> 12. 1688. There was this further Account; We have had nothing conſiderable to entertain us here this Week but the ſad Relations of the terrible Earthquakes at <hi>Naples,</hi> and ſeveral places about it. It happened at <hi>Naples</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> laſt about 21. hours and a half (which at the ſame inſtant was perceived by a great many here) On <hi>Sunday</hi> too it returned. Several Churches, Palaces, and Houſes are ruin'd, among the reſt the famous Church of the Jeſuits, reckoned the fineſt in <hi>Italy,</hi> is all tumbled down, except the Walls and the High Altar. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular number of thoſe killed and buried in the ruins is not known. The laſt Letters ſay, many of the Inhabitants ſie abroad under Tents, in Couches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and continually Prayers, Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, publick Penances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are performed; and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:108503:73"/>every one runs about crying <hi>Miſerecordia,</hi> Mercy, Mercy, Mercy; Three Ships were Sunk in the Harbour, and the Water in the Wells roſe many handfuls. <hi>Benevento</hi> is almoſt totally ruined and of ten thouſand Inhabitants, they ſay there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſcarce ſix hundred alive. Cardinal <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini</hi> their Arch-biſhop was taken out of the Ruins alive, but hurt. Several other Places and Seats are quite ruined and moſt of the Inhabitants ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up. This City and the Countrey hereabout juſt felt the Shock but received no harm. The damage is ſaid to be above fifty Millions.</p>
            <p n="62">LXII. In the ſame year and Month, 1688.

On <hi>June</hi> thirty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 11. and 12. at Noon there happened at <hi>Smyrna</hi> a violent Earthquake, which in a Minute threw down many, and ſhattered all the Houſes in that City; It reached all the adjacent Parts, and <hi>Motelone</hi> and <hi>Scio,</hi> where it did ſome ſmall harm: and at the ſame time that day it was felt here, though the force of it being ſpent by the diſtance, it was not generally taken notice of. About four hours after the Earthquake, a Fire broke out in the <hi>Frank-Street</hi> from an Houſe called the <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſe-Houſe,</hi> which by the ſtrength of the Wind, and in that Conſternation, having no oppoſition ſoon conſumed the <hi>Frank-Street</hi> and all the Town, except the Skirts and the Houſes on the ſide of the Hill, which ſtand ſcattering and not contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The moſt moderate computation of People deſtroyed is 5000. Some make it double the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of which 400. <hi>Jews,</hi> and one of the moſt famous <hi>Chaccham Rabbies</hi> of the Eaſt, <hi>Aaron
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:108503:73"/>Aben Haim,</hi> who as he was much reverenced by them in his life, ſo particular lamentations are made here for his Death. The Metropolite of <hi>Smyrna</hi> with ſome Papa's, went to the Church to Prayers, and were killed by its falling on them. The Patriarch alſo of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had the ſame Fate. And many poor People were buried in the ruins before they could get help. Of the French Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, only the Conſul was killed. Of the Dutch one Merchant: And of the Engliſh three, and ſeveral others were bruiſed and hurt, but not dangerouſly. The Conſul and half of the Nation, it being Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, were abroad, but perceiving the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake came immediately to the City, and all went aboard their Ships in Port. In the interim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſhock of the Earthquake, and the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Fire, great quantities of Goods were ſaved. So that the Engliſh as to their loſs in Merchandiſe have eſcaped much better than the Dutch, who had no Ships in Port. All the lower Ware-houſes in <hi>Viſerchan</hi> are ſaved, but thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Stairs, either by Windows left open, or by the Fire getting in at the Clefts of the Walls ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much and are moſt fallen. The Caſtle at St. <hi>Giacomo-Point</hi> is quite ſunk under ground. A Capigee Baſſa is ſent from hence to <hi>Smyrna</hi> to look after the Grand Seigniors Intereſt in taking the Eſtates of thoſe dead without Heirs, which will add affliction to affliction, but the publick neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties here are great. And the Lord Ambaſſador of <hi>England</hi> has ſent down an Officer, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from the Grand Viſier to be aſſiſting perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culary to our. Nation in looking after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>
            <p n="63">LXIII. In <hi>December</hi> following ſeveral Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes happened about <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Beneventum,</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:108503:74"/>but without ſuch unfortunate Accidents as atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them ſome months before. Nevertheleſs that accident being freſh in memory, it is not to be imagined in what a conſternation the People were, and how they fell to their Prayers in ſeveral Churches. The Monks in thoſe quarters made uſe of the opportunity to preach, That the end of the World was at hand, and for that reaſon endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to a waken the People to give Alms. But in regard (ſaith my Author) that the People are not now to be impoſed upon as formerly, when they uſed ſuch ways to rear thoſe coſtly Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are ſcattered over all Europe, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to keep what they had; not finding the Monks made better uſe of their Money than they themſelves could do.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe it will not be deemed preſumption to aſſert, that theſe dreadful ſhakings of the Earth, did ſeem plainly to preſage thoſe Convulſions that happened ſoon after, and may preſignify good as well as bad Events; Not only the happy Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in theſe three Kingdoms, but alſo the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ruins, devaſtations, and miſeries which the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and barbarity of the French King has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned lately in Chriſtendom, and which do ſtill continue.</p>
            <p n="64">LXIV. Diſmal was the Calamity and Judgment which befel the Inhabitants of the Iſland of <hi>Jamaica</hi> in the Weſt-Indies upon Tueſday <hi>June</hi> 7. 1692. by a dreadful Earthquake. For about eleven a Clock in the morning the Earth ſuffered a great Trepidation, which in a minutes time was increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to that degree that ſeveral Houſes began to rumble down, and in ſix or ſeven minutes or a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour at the moſt, made terrible havock and devaſtation. It threw down almoſt all the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:108503:74"/>Houſes, Churches, Sugar-works, Mills and Bridges through the whole Country. It tore the Rocks and Mountains, and threw them into the Sea, but <hi>Port Royal</hi> had much the greateſt ſhare in this aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgment of God. The Miniſter of that place relates, That the ſame Morning he had been at Prayers in the Church, which he never neglected, to keep up ſome ſhew of Religion amongſt a moſt ungodly, debauched People, and was gone to a place hard by the Church where the Merchants uſe to meet, and where the Preſident of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was, deſigning to dine with one Captain <hi>Ruden,</hi> but his Houſe upon the firſt concuſſion ſunk firſt into the Earth and then into the Sea, with his Wife and Family and ſome others that were come to dine with him, but the Miniſter ſtaying ſome time with the Preſident, eſcaped the danger, yet ſoon after they found the ground rowling and moving under their feet; <hi>Lord Sir,</hi> ſays the Miniſter, <hi>What's this?</hi> He replied very compoſedly, being a ſober grave man, <hi>It is an Earthquake, be not afraid it will ſoon be over,</hi> but it increaſed, and they heard the Church and Tower fall, upon which they ran to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Miniſter quickly loſt the Preſident and made toward <hi>Morgans</hi> Fort, which being a wide open place he thought to be ſecureſt from falling Houſes, but as he came near, he ſaw the Earth open and ſwallow up a multitude of People, and the Sea mounting in over the Fortifications; He then laid aſide all thoughts of eſcaping, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make towards his own Lodgings, and there to meet death in as good a poſture as he could, and in his way was forced to run through two or three very narrow ſtreets, where the Houſes and Walls fell on each ſide of him, and ſome Bricks came rowling over his Shoes, but none hurt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:108503:75"/>him. When he came to his Lodgings he found all things ſafe, not a Picture, of which there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral fair ones in his Chamber, diſplaced. He went to the Balconey to view the ſtreet in which his Houſe ſtood, and ſaw never an Houſe down there, nor the Ground ſo much as crackt. The People ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him there, cryed out for him to come down and pray with them. When he came into the ſtreet every one laid hold on his Cloths and embraced him, ſo that with their fear and kindneſs he was almoſt ſtifled. He perſuaded them at laſt to kneel down and make a large ring, which they did, he pray'd with them near an hour, when being almoſt ſpent with the heat and the exerciſe, they brought him a Chair, the Earth working all the while with new motions and tremblings like the rowling of the Sea, inſomuch that when he was at Prayer he could hardly keep himſelf upon his Knees. By that time he had been about half an hour with them, aggravating their ſins and provocations, and feriouſly exhorting them to repentance, there came ſome Merchants of the place who deſired him to go aboard ſome Ship in the Harbour &amp; refreſh himſelf having got a Boat to carry him off, ſo when he came to the Sea, he ſaw it had ſwallowed up the Wharf, with all thoſe goodly brick Houſes upon it, moſt of them as fine as thoſe in Cheapſide, and two intire Streets beyond that. He walked upon the tops of ſome houſes that lay level with the ſurface of the Water, from whence he gotfirſt into a Canoo, and then into a Long-Boat, which put him a Board a Ship called the <hi>Siam</hi> Merchant, where he found the Preſident ſafe, who was overjoyed to ſee him, they could not ſleep that night for the returns of the Earthquake, almoſt every hour, which made all the Guns in the Ship jar and rattle. The next day
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:108503:75"/>he went from Ship to Ship to viſit thoſe that were bruiſed and dying, and to pray with them, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to do the laſt Office at the ſinking of ſeveral Corps that came floating from the Point. The ſhakings of the Earth ſtill continued with Thunder and Lightning and foul Weather, and the People continued ſtill as deſperately wicked as before, for that very day this terrible Earthquake happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as ſoon as night came on, a Company of lend Rogues called Privateers fell to breaking open Warehouſes and Houſes deſerted. To rob and rifle their Neighbours whilſt the Earth trembled under them, and ſome of the Houſes fell on them in the Act, and thoſe audacious Whores that remained upon the place were as impudent as ever. He went again aſhoar to pray with the bruiſed and dying people, and to Chriſten Children, where he met too many Drunk and Swearing, he did not ſpare them, nor the Magiſtrates neither, who had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wickedneſs to grow to ſuch a height. In the laſt Sermon he preached in the Church, he plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to them the danger of their impenitence and wickedneſs, with ſo much zeal and earneſtneſs that many now confeſſed, It was more like a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy than a Sermon. He ſays he had many times before, an impulſe upon his Spirit to Preach thoſe things which he never premeditated at home, and could not, he thought, do otherwiſe. The morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this dreadful day was very fair and clear, affording no ſuſpicion of the leaſt evil, but in the ſpace of three minutes about half an hour after eleven in the morning, <hi>Port-Royal</hi> the faireſt Town of all the Engliſh Plantations the beſt Emporium and Mart of that part of the World, exceeding in its riches, plentiful of all good things, was ſhaken and ſhattered to pieces, and ſunk into and covered
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108503:76"/>for the greateſt part by the Sea. Few of the Houſes that ſtood were left whole. So that by their falling, the opening of the Earth, and the Inundation of the Waters, it is reckoned there were loſt fifteen hundred Perſons. The Sunday after, the Miniſter Preached to them in a Tent, not daring to venture among the ſhattered Houſes, the People were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed to ſee him among them, and wept bitterly when he Preached to them. It was a ſad ſight to ſee all that Harbour, one of the faireſt and goodlieſt in <hi>America,</hi> covered with the dead bodies of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all conditions, floating up and down without burial; for the great and famous Burial-place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Palliſadoes, was deſtroyed by the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and the Sea waſhed the Carcaſſes of thoſe that were buried out of their Graves, their Tombs being daſhed to pieces by the Earthquake, of which there were hundreds in that place. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Rich men were utterly ruined, whilſt many that were poor, by watching opportunities and ſearching the wrack'd and ſunk Houſes, even almoſt while the Earthquake laſted, and terror and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was upon all the conſiderable People, have gotten great riches. From St. <hi>Anns</hi> there was news that above a thouſand Acres of Wood-land were turned into the Sea, and carried with it whole Plantations, but no place ſuffered like <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> where whole ſtreets were ſwallowed up by the opening of the Earth, and the Houſes and Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants went down together. Some of them were driven up again by the Sea which aroſe in thoſe breaches and wonderfully eſcaped. Some were ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up to the neck, and then the Earth ſhut upon them and ſqueezed them to death, and in that manner ſeveral were left buried, with their heads above ground, only ſome Heads the Dogs had
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108503:76"/>eaten. Others were covered with duſt and Earth by the remaining People to avoid the ſtench Great bellowing and noiſes were heard ſometime after in the Mountains, which made them appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of an Eruption of Fire; but thanks be to God, no ill Event hath yet ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>By a ſecond Letter from another worthy Divine and a Miniſter of the pariſh of <hi>Vere</hi> in that Iſland, ſome Leagues from <hi>Port-Royal;</hi> we have this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Relation of that tremendous Judgment, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>June</hi> 30. 1692. On <hi>Tueſday June</hi> 7. about 11. in the morning it pleaſed the Juſt God to viſit us with a terrible Earthquake, which continued with much violence and terror for about a quarter of an hour, as moſt ſay, but in my opinion not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 6. or 7. minutes, in which time it overthrew all the Brick and Stone Buildings in the Countrey, whereof ſeveral in my own Pariſh, which now are either levelled with the ground, or ſtanding Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the wrath of God, ſo ſhattered and torn that they are irreparable; while theſe were tumbling, the Earth opened in my Pariſh in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of places, and though their dire Chaſms ſpewed out Water to a conſiderable height above ground, in ſuch quantities in ſome places that it made our Gullies run on a ſudden, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exceeding dry, inſomuch that ſome were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of being overwhelmed at once by the River and Sea joyning together to ſwallow up the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; theſe gaping mouths being no leſs than 12, 20. or more foot deep under the Earth, and above two miles up in the Countrey, eſpecially nigh the River in the pureſt mould, which had not Clay nor other conſolidating Matter beneath to oppoſe the force of the Fountains of the Deep breaking up: for where that was, we do not find any cracks of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:108503:77"/>the Earth at all: And yet it pleaſed God that we in this Pariſh have eſcaped the danger much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than our Neighbour Pariſhes; for happening to content our ſelves with mean and low-built Houſes, generally of Timber and Boarded, or with Cratches ſet deep in the ground and plaiſtred, ſuch Houſes are generally ſtanding. So that we have means to aſſiſt one another, whilſt in other parts hundreds of Souls are caſt out of their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and have not a place to hide their Heads in, except in Booths and Tents which they have ſince built to ſhade themſelves from the Sun. Our noted Town of St. <hi>John de la Vega:</hi> Or, <hi>The Spaniſh Town</hi> is utterly down to the ground, and its Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in the ſame Ruins; Our Magazine and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Store-Houſe of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> is three parts ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the Sea, Ships and Shallops now riding at Anchor where great numbers of fine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks ſtood not long ſince. Many eminent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants worth thouſands, have ſcarce any thing left but the blue Linnen on their backs; ſeveral are dead, either overwhelmed with their Houſes, or drowned in the Sea, which flowed in ſuddenly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. For while they fled from the Sea, the Earth devoured them in her gaping Jaws, or they were killed with the falling Houſes; and while they fled from the gaping Chaſms of the Earth, or the tottering buildings, the Sea met and ſwept them away. A whole Street called the <hi>Wharf,</hi> (where moſt of the noted Merchants lived, and where much of the Planters goods were landed, for conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of Sale and Shipping; particularly Sugar and Cotten) ſunk at once from one end to the other with a general crack at the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ear thquake, together with two Forts Guns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thereon; and all that were upon or nigh
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108503:77"/>it periſhed in an inſtant without warning: and ſoon after while the People were in the greateſt horror and conſternation imaginable, not knowing whither to fly for ſafety, two or three more Streets in their whole length rottered and fell, and were immediately funk, ground and all together deep into the Sea, as far as the <hi>Jews</hi> Street; All the Upper part of the Town, with the Church, and all above the Palliſadoes is under Water, even the very Palliſadoes it ſelf where their burying place was, is now no longer Earth but Sea; and the dead Corps floated from thence to all parts of the Harbour. The Houſes that yet remain are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them ſo rent and torn, and others ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſunk into the Water, even up to their Balco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that they are unſerviceable. The Wall at the Palliſadoes is utterly ruin'd, with the Port thereto belonging; and though <hi>Morgans</hi> Line, and <hi>Walkers</hi> Fort yet ſtand, they are ſorely ſhaken and rent, and ſo ſunk they are not tenable, the whole place that is yet above Water ſinking daily by thoſe Earthquakes we have ever ſince had; ſometimes 4, 5, 6. times, more or leſs in 24. hours. I my ſelf while I am now writing, expecting when the Earth will tremble under me, though in other parts of the Countrey through Gods mercys we do not hear of any further damage ſince the firſt. The reputed number of the Dead, (for perhaps there will never be an exact Account) is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about 1500 perſons, beſides Negro's, who are thought to be 6. or 700 more, a multitude of whoſe Black Corps floated many days from one ſide of the Harbour to the other, which cauſed ſuch an intollerable ſtench that the dead were like to deſtroy the Living; till at laſt ſome were ſunk, and others diſperſed by the Sea-breeze.</p>
            <pb n="148" facs="tcp:108503:78"/>
            <p>Imediately upon the Ceſſation of the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, your heart would abhor to hear of the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beryes and Violences committed in an inſtant upon the place, by the vileſt and baſeſt of the People. No man could call any thing his own, for they that were ſtrongeſt and moſt wicked ſeized what and whoſe they pleaſed without regard to the Owners, Gold and Silver, Jewels, Plate or Goods was all their own if they could lay hands on them. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but breaking open Houſes, ruſhing into Shops, and taking from the owners what they pleaſed even before their faces; Yea Robbing them of Money and goods in the open Street, as they were carrying them to other places for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: whilſt others in Canoes, Wherries, Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were plundring Cheſts, Boxes, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of what they could find in them upon the Water: Even the very Slaves thinking it their time of Liberty, committed many barbarous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies and Robberyes, till they were ſuppreſt by the Death of ſome and puniſhment of others. And indeed our firſt fears were concerning our Blacks, thoſe irreconciliable and yet inteſtine Enemies of ours, who are no otherwiſe our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects than as the whip makes them, who ſeeing our ſtrongeſt Houſes demoliſht, our Army broken, and hearing of the deſtruction of our greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency the Town of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> might in hopes of Liberty be ſtirred up to riſe in Rebellion againſt us; which is a War always the more terrible, by how much there is no quarter given in it, but they kill and ſlay all the Whites, Men, Women and Children that they can Conquer; But God be praiſed thoſe fears are now blown over. Many days did theſe Depredations laſt, eſpecially upon the Water, where the dead were Rob'd of what
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:108503:78"/>they had about them, ſome ſtript, others ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their Pockets pick'd, their Fingers cut off for their Rings, their Gold Buttons taken out of their ſhirts, and then they were turn'd adrift again. From thence was taken all manner of ſtores that would ſwim, every one taking that for his own which he could lay his hands on, as Pork, Beef, Mackril, Saltfiſh, Coaca, Candle, Soap, Wine, Beer, Brandy, and a vaſt deal of other things, not to be thought of, or reckoned up. So that the richeſt became pooreſt, and the meaneſt of the people were inriched by the loſſes of others, to eſtimate which ſeems as difficult as to reckon the number of the People loſt, and deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Port-Royal</hi> in its flouriſhing condition was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Empory and Mart Town for the Weſt Indle's and the Archinto being ſetled there, a very large ſhare of the riches of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> were brought thither, and vaſt ſums of Coin and Bullion yearly tranſported for <hi>England,</hi> to the great inriching of the Jamaican Merchants and Factors, ſo that it was hard to compare what was loſt, but many think, at leaſt, the value of four hundred Thouſand Pound at <hi>Port-Royall</hi> only; Yet in the midſt of this woful Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, ſome People were miracolouſly preſerved from Death, being ſwallowed down into the Bowels of the Earth alive, yet ſpued up again and ſaved by the violent Eruption of Water through thoſe Gaps, Others, as themſelves affirm, (if they were then capable of knowing what was done to them,) were ſwallowed up in one place, and by the ruſhing of the Waters to and fro, by reaſon of the Agitartion of the Earth at that time; were caſt up again by another Chaſm at places far diſtant. But the general means of Preſervation was by Peoples flying as faſt as they could toward the back Sea ſide, or ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly getting aboard the Ships in the Harbour, which were croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Men, Women and Children: Among others a Man of War, the <hi>Swallow</hi> then in Harbour was ſo damaged by the fall of the Houſes that ſhe became utterly unſerviceable, and Twelve Shallops were ſunk by the ſame means.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe <hi>Ligania,</hi> the firſt and principal Town for Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and imitating if not exceeding, the ſtately Buildings of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108503:79"/>
               <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> is now brought to moſt terrible Deſolation, and its fine New Built and yet Unfiniſhed Church buried in the ſame ruin with the Houſes. Above which place the Coſtly Blue Mountains lift up their heads, but are now ſo rent and torn, that they are fearful to behold and ſtand like laſting marks of Divine Wrath; which hath alſo happened in other parts of the Countrey which is very Hilly in the middle, ſo that by the fall of a Mountain into the Channel of the River which ſupplies both this Town and <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> with Water, the River became dry for ſixteen hours together, to the terror of the Inhabitants, fearing the Deſertion as well as Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the place, till it afterwards Run again as formerly, and they were informed of the cauſe of the Stoppage of the Water for ſo long a time.</p>
            <p>This, among other reaſons, was the Cauſe why the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were ſaved at <hi>Port-Poyal</hi> were almoſt periſhed for Thirſt in their deep Extremity; their own Water-casks being either ruined or ſwam away into the Sea, and no Boats to fetch any in that Diſmal Conſternation, or otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to ſave Peoples Lives, or to get Plunder. Or if any did go, there was no Water to be had; ſo that it was hard to be gotten and very dear, many paying great rates only to quench their Thirſt. And yet for all theſe Woful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters, great Numbers of People are not all Reformed of their Wickedneſs which brought them upon us, but there is the ſame Whoring and Drinking, the ſame Curſing and Swearing, if not worſe, than formerly; So that we have cauſe to fear the Judgment of <hi>Sodom</hi> may be our next puniſhment.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of our Diſtreſs it pleaſed God to give us a Signal Victory over our Enemies the French, who happened at that time to make the Sharpeſt Attack upon us ſince the War, having Landed, as we hear, Two Hundred men on the North ſide of the Iſland, which is but weakly furniſht with men, where they intrenched themſelves, but were ſhamefully beaten out by a Vigorous Attack in the Night by a Party of about Thirty Men, who Slew Seven or Eight out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and the reſt flying to their Boats, Thirty of them were drowned; While in the mean time our Fleet, which was ſet out on purpoſe, perſuing theirs, we took one Shallop, and made them deſperately blow up their great Ship; ſuch as were ſaved remaining our Priſoners, and others fled home to give an Account of their overthrow.</p>
            <pb n="151" facs="tcp:108503:79"/>
            <p>To conclude, God in his Diſpleaſure remembred Mercy, for though ſuch Numbers periſht at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> where they were thronged together in an Iſthmus of Land; yet I cannot hear of fifty Perſons both Whites and Blacks that were loſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide throughout all the Iſland.</p>
            <p>Other Letters add theſe particulars; That this terrible Earthquake came from the North, and attacked <hi>Port-Royal</hi> on the Harbour ſide, on which was the Wharf the whole length of the place, where ſtood the Kings Houſe, a Baſtion of 207. Guns, <hi>Carlile</hi> Battery of 119. Guns, and the Houſes of the greateſt Merchants; All thoſe Sunk down in a moment from three to five fathom of Water. Some were ſunk in their Houſes, others buried in the Rubbiſh, ſome who were got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to clear Water and could Swim were carried away with drifts of Timber and tops of Houſes, driven by a ſteering carreer and there periſhed. Nothing elſe was ſeen but the Dead and Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nothing heard but Shrieks and Cries, the Living were covered with Wounds, Bruiſes and Blood; The Thunder Roared over their Heads, the Earth Trembled under their Feet, the Rocks and Mountains were rent in ſunder, and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals fell by day and night from Heaven, ſo that the moſt hardened Atheiſts might have conſidered that there was a God who Governed the World.

            <p n="65">LXV. In the ſame year 1692. <hi>Sept.</hi> 8. an Earthquake was felt in <hi>London,</hi> and in ſeveral parts of <hi>Eſſex, Kent, Suſſex, Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Sheerneſs, Sandwick, Deal, Maidſtone, Poriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> &amp;c. the People leaving their houſes in many places leaſt they ſhould fall on their heads, but it laſted only a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute. It ſhook <hi>Leeds</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> ſo violently that all in the Caſtle, even the Lady her ſelf went out of it, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its falling. A Perſon being in the Field hard by, the ground ſhook ſo under him that he could not ſtand, and being forced to lye down on the Ground was ſo toſſed up and down, that he received ſeveral bruiſes. At <hi>Maidſtone</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> the people generally got out of their houſes fearing they would fall. It happened at <hi>London</hi> about four minutes paſt two, and was felt in moſt part of the Durch and Spaniſh Netherlands, as alſo in <hi>Germany, France,</hi> &amp;c. The account from <hi>Holland</hi> runs thus. On <hi>Sept.</hi> 8. between two or three a Clock in the Afternoon all <hi>Holland</hi> was ſenſible of a trembling of the Earth which laſted about three minutes. The ſhog, or joiting, which it cauſed three times one after another, was not violent, for it did no damage, but it was plainly perceptible and very much alarm'd the People: At <hi>Middleburg</hi> in <hi>Zealand</hi> it continued for ſome time, and cauſed the Earth to move ſo much, that the people was forced to hold by what was next in the Street, and it was feared that the Steeple of the great Church by its motions, would have fallen, it cauſing the Bells both there and at the <hi>Hague</hi> to jahgle, and the Ships at Sea were ſenſible of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gazaet</hi> relates, that our Gracious Sovereign King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium</hi> being encamped at <hi>Grammen</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> at the ſame time there happened an Earthquake which laſted near a minute, and was very ſenſible to the whole Camp. The King was then at Dinner in an old decayed Houſe, which ſhaking very much, and every one apprehending it was ready to fall, His Majeſty
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:108503:80"/>was prevailed with to riſe from Table to go out of the Houſe but the ſurprize was ſoon over.</p>
            <p>An ingenious Gentleman has made obſervation that this Earthquake affected places moſt on the Seacoſts, and near great Rivers, which ſeems to favour the opinion of another learned Perſon, That Water and not Wind is the cauſe of Earthquakes, which the Ancient Philoſophers did alſo aſſert. And therefore ſaith he, the exceſſive Rains which fell that Summer, in far greater quantity than what the Earth could poſſibly receive, being ſhut up in the hollow Caverns and Bowels of the Earth, and ſtriving to get out again, may have cauſed theſe Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſhivering Fits in our European parts: and there is this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to corroborate this Conjecture, for that very great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes indeed, are many times attended with violent Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Rivers being ſwell'd with the Water which the Earth has let out. Another odd accident that followed this Earthquake was the effect it had upon the <hi>Spa</hi> Waters in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> which are ſo famour and ſo wholeſom, and are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come much more improved ſince that happened. <hi>Spa</hi> is a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough in the Countrey of <hi>Liege,</hi> where there are ſeveral Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Fountains, to which a great number of people reſort at all ſeaſons of the Year. Among all the Springs belonging to that noted Burrough, that in the middle out of which the Bottles are fill'd that are ſent over all Europe every year, is changed after a very extraordinary manner. The ſource of it is as big again as it was, and the Water which before was ſeldom clear is become extreamly Limpid, and is of that ſtrength that the Bottles if they be ſtopt immediately after they are hil'd, break all in pieces, which never happened till ſince this late Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. The reſt of the Springs are alſo become much clearer and better. This will be a ſubject for thoſe to exerciſe their Pens, who make it their buſineſs to dive into the ſecrets of Nature.</p>
            <p>This Earthquake went not beyond 52 Degrees and 40 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of Northern Latitude. How far it reached South and Eaſt is not yet certainly known. It has been traced beyond, <hi>Paris</hi> to the 48 degree of North Latitude, and beyond the <hi>Rhyne</hi> on the Eaſt to <hi>Franckfort,</hi> ſo that 260 Miles ſquare were ſhaken by it. The time of its happening here, and beyond the Seat ſeem to vary ſome minutes, but that may eaſily be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, by the difference of Meridians. So that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed Damp; ſaith Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> which cauſed this Earthquake was lodged ſleep in the Earth, the Caverns that contained it paſſing under the bottom of the Sea.</p>

            <p>The ſame year, 1692. <hi>Oct.</hi> 15. about three a Clock in the Morning they felt an Earthquake at <hi>Bale</hi> and <hi>Schaffouſe</hi> in <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> which was very violent as to the motion, but did no harm at all.</p>
            <p n="66">LXVI. I have already given an Account of divers Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes and Irruptions of the dreadful Burning Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> for many years paſt, but that which lately happened in this unfortunate Iſland is of ſo aſtoniſhing a Nature that it may be more eaſily imagined than expreſt, and which can hardly be parallel'd in any former Age; Both for the ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, and the mighry defolations it did produce? This tremendous Eauthquake (a greater than which we read not of either in Ancient or modern Hiſtory) Was upon <hi>Jan.</hi> 7. 1692, At which time about ten at night, Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> began to roar in a moſt horrible manner, which uſually preſages ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Calamity to enſue. Its loud bellowings continued for two days. and then began to ceaſe and fall lower; and about an hour after the People of <hi>Catania.</hi> which was neareſt to the Mountain felt a trembling under them for near three Minutes, during which no noiſe was heard from Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> ſo that it only affrighted the Inhabitants: but within a Minute after the Roaring of the Mountain was redoubled with infinite ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and the top thereof appeared all in Flames, and the Weſt Wind carried away a great quantity of burnt Aſhes; This trembling of the 9th. was felt in the Cities of <hi>Mineo, Palaonia, Ragoſa, Licodia</hi> and moſt of the South parts of <hi>Sicily</hi> at the ſame inſtant with that of <hi>Catania.</hi> But the moſt tremendous ſhake of all happened on <hi>Jan.</hi> 11. which affected the whole Iſland in a more or leſs degree, even from <hi>Meſſina</hi> North, to Cape <hi>Coio</hi> the fartheſt Southern point of <hi>Sicily;</hi> and though it continued but Six Minutes, yet made horrible Ravage through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Countrey. Under which dimal Calamity the Ancient City of <hi>Catania,</hi> pleaſantly Seated, and full of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Quality, with an Univerſity, and about 24000. People, in a Minute was ſunk out of ſight, with a noiſe as loud as if thouſands of Cannons had been diſcharged at once; and ſome Moments after, to the Eaſt where the City ſtood, a little Mountain, advanced it ſelf ſeveral times a conſiderable height above the ſurface of the adjacent ground, but ſoon after became likewiſe iuviſible. The diſmal bellowing of Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> was louder both before and after, and appeared more than ever in Flames; Yet a few Minutes after <hi>Catania</hi> was ſwallowed up, there was neither Flames viſible, nor for five or
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108503:81"/>ſix hours any Roarings to be heard. After which it began to rage and throw out more Black and Smoaky Flaſhes than at any time before. Theſe particulars were obſerved by ſome Fiſhermen who happened at that time to be in their Boats in the Bay to the South, and within three Miles of the City, who expected every moment to have been ſwallowed up by the wonderful Agitation of the Waves; But upon the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the imaginary Mountain aforementioned the Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came inſtantly Calm; It is computed that not above 2000. of the Inhabitants of this City eſcaped, and thoſe of the Gentry, who by the ſhake of the 9th. inſtant, and the hideous roaring of Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> the 11th. in the morning, which is the uſual preſage of ſome diſmal Tragedy were frighted away; all the reſt of the People periſhing in this lamentable ruin. In the place where <hi>Catania</hi> ſtood ſome heaps of rubbiſh and a great Lake of Water appear at a diſtance.</p>
            <p>Some Letters add, That juſt as the Earthquake in <hi>Catania</hi> began to be perceived, the Sea retired about two Miles from the Shoar; which put the People into ſuch a terrible fright, that every one betook himſelf to what he thought might beſt ſecure him from this dreadful Scourge of Heaven; Away they flew to the Cathedral where one of the <hi>Cannous</hi> carryed about the Reliques of St <hi>Agatha</hi> the Patroneſs of that City, but neither the Reliques nor the Prayers of the Patroneſs could prevent the impending ſtroke, for the whole City was deſtroyed in a moment after, and all the People there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>Under the ſame diſmal Calamity fell the Ancient City of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> ſo famous in Hiſtory that it was formerly reckoned one of the greateſt in the World; having for many Centuries been the Metropolis of a Renowned Republick, and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome marks of its preſtine Grandeur, ſeated in a Rich and pleaſant Soil, with a ſtrong Caſtle, and about 16000. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. By the Earthquake of the 9th. many principal Houſes and moſt part of the Caſtle were torn in divers places, and the next night it was again ſhaken with ſo terrible a ſtorm of Wind, that the great Bell in one of the Churches made a noiſe by the violent Motion of the Steeple. Many were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Tempeſt, and the reſt fled out of the City for ſafety in the Night, and ſo eſcaped the horrible devaſtation of the 11th, wherein two thirds of the buildings were thrown down, and above 7000. People buried in the Rubbiſh; a great number were digged out of the Ruins, but ſo bruiſed that there was little hope of their Recovery. The Chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108503:82"/>and People of Condition fled for ſecurity into the great Church, but there met with Death by the fall of the Stone-Roof and Steeple at once.</p>
            <p>Neither did <hi>Noto</hi> though built upon a very high Bock, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inacceſſible on all ſides but one narrow way, and a City which formerly contended with <hi>Syracuſe</hi> for dignity, partake of a leſs diſmal fate. It has one of the largeſt and beſt Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and is the Key of the Countrey on that ſide; and though the hardneſs of the Rock whereon it ſtood ſeem'd to ſecure it, yet the trembling of the 9th did very much affect it, and on the 11th laid it in heaps in a minute, all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, except ſome few who fled from thence on the 9th were buried under the ruins of their own Houſes, being reckoned about 7000. a part of a Church, and very little more, remaining ſtanding in the whole Town <hi>Auguſta,</hi> a City in a <hi>Peni-inſula,</hi> on the Eaſt of <hi>Sicily,</hi> with a large proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the Sea, ſafe Harbours and conſiderable Trade, was much damaged on the 9th inſtant and about 600 People kill'd by the downfal of the Houſes. The next day the ſhake was renewed, which cauſed moſt of the Gentry to fly to the Caſtle for ſecurity, but there being terrible Lightning, a Magazine of Powder took Fire and about 1100 Perſons who ſought for ſafety were ſlain there in the deſtruction of the Caſtle which was blown up in the Air, and the following day the reſt of the Town and the remaining Inhabitants by another dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhake, were utterly deſtroyed and buried in rubbiſh, ſo that of 6000 People none were left alive. <hi>Lentini</hi> the ancient <hi>Lecotium,</hi> a Town of about 3000 Families was burnt to the ground on the 11th and nothing to be ſeen but ſeveral great heaps of Earth in the beautiful Lake upon which it ſtood, the Water whereof is now become brackiſh, and of a bituminous taſt, which was before very clear. And great quantity of Fiſh are found dead on the ſhoar. <hi>Calatgirmie</hi> a Town well built of Free-ſtone, by the ſhake on the 11th had a fifth part of the buildings and two Monaſteries demoliſhed, but of 7000 People 5000 made their eſcape. <hi>Mineo</hi> was ſtriken both the 9th and 11th, of the former the Heavens were ſealene with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Cloud, but on the latter there was a terrible ſtorm of Lightning and Thounder for ſix hours together. At both times ſeveral houſes and a large Church were overthrown, and it was judged about 4000 People periſhed. The ſhake of the 11th did likewiſe greatly ſhatter the Cathedral Church of <hi>Monreal,</hi> one of the moſt famous ſtructures in the World. The <hi>Dome</hi> above the high Altar falling, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3+ letters">

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:108503:82"/>curious Braſs Pillars, and many Images of Saints of rare work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip. Part of the Archbiſhops Palace was burnt with Lightning, and ſome few of the Inhabitants were killed by the fall of Houſes. <hi>Parermo,</hi> where the Viceroy of <hi>Sicily</hi> keeps his Court, received ſome damage in its Cathedral, and another Church was ruined, which obliged the Viceroy, his Family, and the Archbiſhop to go aboard the Galleys in the Harbor, where they expected death every moment from the violent motion of the Waves, ſome part of the great Mole being ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, yet not above 100 People were killed in this famous City, who lived in a Suburb built of Wood. The Town of <hi>Paſceni</hi> of about 200 Inhabitants was ſo entirely ruined, that not one houſe or perſon was ſaved. The ſpacious Valley ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining, which was formerly full of excellent Vines being turned into a new Lake, whoſe Water is brackiſh and like Brimſtone. In <hi>Patuzolo</hi> a place of about 1000 people all were ſwallowed up. <hi>Furla</hi> another Town of about the ſame number of Souls, had the like fate, and the Rocks adjacent which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were white as Marble, are now black and as if burne with Fire and Gunpowder, and the Fountains of fair Water are become muddy and taſt of Brimſtone. <hi>Sciorti</hi> a bigger Town than the three laſt, was totally demoliſhed and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants which were reckoned about 2000 ſo utterly deſtroy'd that none were left to tell the news. No more than there were at <hi>Militello,</hi> where of 6000 People no one is left to give tydings how or when its calamity happened The Countrey People who dwell in the Mountains about it affirm that for three days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could not diſcern the Town by reaſon of a thick Fog which ſurrounded it, but that on the 11th in the morning it was no more to be ſeen. A great part of the Mountain on the North ſide is torn aſunder, and the one half overwhelmed the Town, leaving a deep Gulph betwixt that and the other part of the Mountain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luechela</hi> had better fortune for of 2000 near half eſcaped, having happily had warning by ſome former ſhakes, and by the Earths ſwallowing up an old Caſtle which ſtood on a riſing ground two miles from thence, in a minutes time, no ſign of its ſtation remaining, but inſtead thereof a vaſt quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters iſſued out, which in a little time made a large Lake. Upon ſight whereof half the Inhabitants of this Town fled from thence, and the reſt with all the buildings were utterly deſtroy'd. <hi>Palonia</hi> another ſmall Town received much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage by the fall of a Church one of the beautifulleſt in <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> which was ſhattered to pieces on the 11th, and the Dome
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:108503:83"/>falling cruſhed to Death 300 Perſons and the Prieſt that was ſaying Maſs, moſt of the remaining Inhabitants got into the Fields, and many other Houſes did not fall, ſo that the loſs was not ſo great as in other places. <hi>Buchino</hi> another large Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage alſo, eſcaped without much ſlaughter of People, though moſt of the Houſes fell, at <hi>Seodia</hi> a Village about the ſame bigneſs 150 people were kill'd by the fall of the Church, and the buildings much ſhaken. Likewiſe a Lake about a mile thence, which was two miles about, and very deep was on the 11th wholly ſwallowed up by the opening of the Earth in the middle of it, and the Channel left dry Land, which ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues. <hi>Chirramonte</hi> another Village, was utterly overthrown and 3 or 400 hundred of the Inhabitants buried in the ruins. <hi>Monteruſſo</hi> was ſhaken, but 200 people flying to the Caſtle for ſecurity were with that buried in the ground, and a Pool of faltiſh Water aroſe in the place. <hi>Vizzini</hi> a fine Town built on the ſide of a Hill of the hardeſt ſtones like marble which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enſure it from ſuch accidents, yet felt ſome ſhakes on the 9th, which affrighted the Chief Inhabitants, ſo that they lived in Tents in the Fields, but hearing no more the next day, they returned home on the 11th in the morning and in a few hours the Town and themſelves conſiſting of about 3500 Souls, were ſwallowed up in the Earth. <hi>Modica</hi> a large Village was the only place that was utterly ruined by the ſhake of the 9th, and that ſo very ſuddenly that of about 1400 People not one was left alive. A River about two miles from thence was overwhelmed by the fall of a Mountain, but afterwards found a new paſſage underneath it, as hath likewiſe happened to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Rivers in <hi>Sicily,</hi> the Earth being thrown over them like a Bridge or Vault. <hi>Biſenti</hi> another Village loſt 200 Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and ſome few houſes were ſnaken down. A little Town called <hi>Francofome</hi> built moſt of Timber, though not much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged by the Earthquakes, yet a dreadful ſtorm of Thunder and Lightning for three days together burnt down the ſpire of the Church Steeple, which was of Wood covered with Lead. The Nunnery of the Carmelites was almoſt ruined, ſo ſuddenly that five Nuns were ſmothered in Bed. But not above 12 or 14 Houſes more burnt.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Carlontoni</hi> was ſhaken on the 9th, and ſome Houſes and People were deſtroyed, which ſo alarmed the Biſhop and Magiſtrates that they perſuaded the Inhabitants to go into the Fields; About four a Clock next day moſt of them with the beſt things they could carry away deſerted the Town, and the Morning after the whole Town was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108503:83"/>in a momens, and of 4000. People not above 800. were killed, by reaſon of their happy removal. <hi>Raguſa</hi> a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned City for Scituation, Buildings and all other Humane Delights, had a great ſhare in this common Calamity. On <hi>Jan.</hi> 8. it had ſeveral ſhakes with a terrible ſtorm of Thunder and Lightning, but on the 11th. the Town Houſe, a ſtately Building with, two Churches and divers Houſes were deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; One of the beſt Streets in the Town, inhabited by Rich Merchants and Tradeſmen, ſunk into the Earth in a moment leaving a mighty Chaſma or Gaping in the place; One of the Churches ſunk alſo, but the other fell down, the modeſteſt Calculations reckon eight thouſand People ſlain, moſt of them of principal Quality. Within this Gap the tops of ſome Houſes are viſible, from whence proceeds a Noxious Sulphury ſmell. In <hi>Scodia</hi> only the Biſhops Palace, newly built was overturned and 24. Perſons were buried in the Rubbiſh, the Biſhop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being abſent, the reſt of the Town eſcaping. <hi>Specaſurno</hi> another conſiderable Town was ſhaken the 9th, whereby the Convent of the <hi>Capuchint</hi> was deſtroyed. All the next day ſo horrible a ſtorm of Thunder and Lightning happened as is not to be expreſt or imagined, whereby the Town-Houſe a very fine ſtructure, and ſome other Buildings were ruined; which frighted a few of the Inhabitants into the Flields, but the next morning in one Minute the whole Town was laid in vaſt heaps of Rubbiſh, and the Freſh-water Lake a Mile off was made almoſt dry Land, the remaining Water being Black and Brackiſh, the Fiſh wherewith it abounded lying all dead on the Shoar; The Inhabitants that periſht were accounted at leaſt 3500. and about 300 ſaved themſelves by going away the day before. The Town of <hi>Scichilo</hi> ſuffered 20. ſhakes ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively on the 8th, each greater than the other; and on the 11th. in leſs than two Minutes was wholly brought to deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and vaniſht out of ſight, a ſtinking Pool of Water ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, wherein the Cathedral of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> and part of St. <hi>Salvator</hi> Steeple appears above Water. It was judged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain about ſix or ſeven Thouſand People of which, it is thought not one made their eſcape; An old ſtrong Caſtle at the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Town likewiſe fell, and thirty People periſht there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. At <hi>Cafamero</hi> a Village of 200. Houſes the People were ſo affrighted at the ſhake three days before ſucceſſively, that on the 11th, moſt of them fled to the Church to beg the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of St. <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Sienna</hi> in a Chappel held venerable among them, but there they met with death altogether, the Roof of Lead falling and cruſhing 200, of them in the Church,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:108503:84"/>and about 20. more were killed in the Village. In <hi>Cafamero</hi> only the Timber Houſes ſuffered and about an hundred Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were deſtroyed, the reſt flying into the Fields. In the little Town of <hi>Giamontano</hi> about 400. Perſons periſhed in that Quarter of the Town next the River, the other part eſcaped. In the Tower of <hi>Livodia,</hi> all the Timber Houſes and three hundred of the Inhabitants were deſtroyed, the Cathedral was burnt down by Lightning, and likewiſe the famous Pine-Trees on an Hill near ajoyning.

                  </gap>ſſina</hi> a great and famous City for Buildings Trade and Riches, was ſo ſenſibly ſhaken on the 9th. that above half the Inhabitants abandoned it, and retired into the Fields; The reſt imployed themſelves in Prayers and Vows, and the Churches were filled with multitudes of all Ages; Fourty Eight hours Prayers were Ordered, and many Relicks were carried in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion through the Streets. On the 11th. Twenty Six Palaces, and many Timber Houſes were overturned, and the whole City ſo fearfully ſhaken that every one expected preſent Death, and the Archbiſhop and the other Prieſts having given the People Abſolution they all endeavoured to avoid the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent peril by flying into the Fields where yet they ſuffered much by the horrible Thunder, Lightning and Rain which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued three days together, ſo that they were obliged to ſet up Tents for ſecurity; So that few were killed, but moſt of the Churches much damaged.</p>
            <p>Neither was there ſecurity from this terrible Viſitation of God, even upon the VVater, ſeveral ſmall Ships and veſſels being caſt away all along the Coaſt by the fury of the VVaves; the Tydes being three foot higher in moſt parts than was ever known before. The damage and loſs in this terrible ſudden and ſurprizing Deſolation in Money, Goods, Houſes and Lands is unaccountable; The leaſt that has been computed amounts to the value of ſix Millions of Ducates, and an 100 years will ſcarce repair the damage: But the greateſt loſs was of People, of whom there periſht by this dreadful Judgment at leaſt an Hundred and Twenty Thouſand Souls, beſides a multitude maimed and wounded by the fall of buildings which died afterward, and may be reckoned Twenty Thouſand more.</p>

            <p>In ſhort amore Aſtoniſhing, a more Univerſal and more Swift Deſtruction was never known; And <hi>Sicily</hi> that was one of the moſt Beautiful, Rich and Fruitful Iſlands in the World, is now an heap of Rubbiſh, and a continued Deſolation.</p>
            <p n="67">LXVII. I have before menrioned ſome of the Natural Cauſes of Earthquakes, and the Philoſophers of <hi>Italy</hi> are apt to aſſign the Cauſes of this aſtoniſhing Calamity to proceed from the unſeaſonable Summer preceeding, and that the many great Rains and Heats which often ſucceeded each other in <hi>Sicily</hi> the laſt year might occaſion great ſtore of vapours to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Bowels of the Earth, which afterward dilating themſelves for want of room forced their way into the Air with the deſtruction of all that oppoſed them. But theſe are only the gueſſes of ſhort-ſighted Men, for the hand of Heaven ſeemed viſible in this terrible Devaſtation; And as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore related ſome of the Preſages that uſually preceed ſuch ſweeping Judgments; ſo the Prognoſticks which uſhered in this horrible deſolation, and of which there were a Multitude of Witneſſes; may be judged intimations, and Effects of the Divine Vengeance theſe following being very remarkable; That in <hi>June</hi> the Summer before Mount <hi>Aetna's</hi> Roarings and Noiſe was extraordinary dreadful, which is always reckened the forerunner of ſome Irruption, either of the Mount it ſelf or ſome part thereabout; And <hi>May</hi> 15. preceeeding, two hours before Sunſet the Sky being Clear, the Heavens ſuddenly appeared all in Flames, without either Lightning or Thunder, which continued about a quarter of an hour; And at the ſame time two Rainbows were ſeen in the Air directly above the City pointing as uſually toward the Earth, and a third with the points upward toward Heaven, being all three extream bright; and that which occaſioned aſtoniſhment in the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and made it really Supernatural, was, that during the whole time of the appearance of the Rainbows, not the leaſt Cloud was viſible in any part of the Horizon; In <hi>July</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one of the Churches of <hi>Carania,</hi> Father <hi>Baletti</hi> a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon much Reverenced by the Common People, lay buried. whoſe Tomb was much adored, and daily Prayers and Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings made at his Shrine; It happened that one merning when the Doors of the Church were opened, the Image of this Saint which was erected on his Tomb, was fallen flat on the ground. It was thought at firſt to be a common accident, but being again ſet up in its place for ſeven or eight nights together it was found conſtantly fallen on the ground, and at laſt was ſorted to be ſaid flat upon the Tomb; where it continned till
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:108503:85"/>the ruin of the Church and City together; The People were taught to believe. that about an hundred twenty years ſince, a Flood of Brimſtone and Fire breaking out of Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> and approaching with great fury and the deſtruction of all in its paſſage toward the Gates of <hi>Catania,</hi> the Citizens expecting nothing but immediate Ruin from it, this Holy Man by his Prayers and Exorciſms put a ſtop thereto in the preſence of all the People, and thereby prevented the approaching deſolation. Again in <hi>February</hi> before, about Sunſet the Counntrey People about <hi>Alari</hi> a ſmall village within three Miles of <hi>Catania</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thought they ſaw that Village all in Flames which ſhewed at firſt but little, yet in a quarter of an hour all the Houſes ſeemed on a light Fire; which appearance continued about ſix minutes, and then ſeemed to decay for want of Fuel. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ſaw it ran with all ſpeed thither to help to quench it, and all along the Road they imagined it increaſed, but being come thither they found all but an Apparition, or rather Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick of the Calamity that ſome Months after befel the place.</p>
            <p n="68">LXVIII. This terrible Earthquake communicated it ſelf to the Iſland of <hi>Malta</hi> on the one ſide and to <hi>Calabria</hi> on the other.

They began to perceive it on the ninth, and next day they felt five or ſix ſhakes, and on the 11th about 3 afternoon it was ſo violent and laſted ſo long that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants believed the whole City would have been inſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, the Bells of the Metropolis of the Iſland rung, the Roof of the Church of our Lady <hi>de Pelay</hi> was thrown down, with part of that of St. <hi>Laurence.</hi> The Church and Colledge of the Jeſuits alſo ſuffered very much, but the Cathedral and the Church of <hi>la Guſmane</hi> received the greateſt damage, and are ſo ruined that they can hardly be repaired, The reſt of the Churches and moſt of the Houſes are extreamly ſhattered and deferted by the Inhabitants. The Great Maſter of the Order was then abroad a hunting, with a great number of other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who were all in danger to have been buried in the Gulph that was made in the midſt of a Rock almoſt under their feet. It is reckoned that the loſſes occaſioned by this Earthquake in the Iſle of <hi>Malta</hi> amount to two hundred thouſand Crowns. The Grand Maſter having underſtood what had happened in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and that their principal Cities from whence they had their ſuſtenance were ruined, he inſtantly diſpatcht away ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Galleys laden with Corn to relieve thoſe wretched People
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:108503:85"/>but arriving at the Port of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> there were ſuch mighty Thunders and Lightnings that they could not enter in. They went back to Sea and ſtaid for better weather, and then made a ſecond attempt, but there aroſe ſo violent a Wind that they were forced to return for fear of being caft away.</p>
            <p n="69">LXIX. The Monthly Mercury gives an account that toward the end of <hi>September</hi> 1693. Another great Earthquake hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at <hi>Catania,</hi> and the Parts adjoining, but, the damage that enſued was very ſmall, Nevertheleſs it was obſerved that during the moſt violent ſhakes the top of Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> was conſiderably ſunk. The Duke of <hi>Canaſtra</hi> Vicar General who was then about <hi>Catanea,</hi> ſent certain Perſons to view the Mount, who perceived that the top was fallen in above 600 foot within the compaſs of about 2000 feet, and that all the Earth was tumbled down into the gaping Chaſm which was about ſix miles in circumference. At the ſame time all the Fountains of <hi>Taurmina</hi> and parts adjacent dried up, and the Earth opened at the foot of an Hill which is about a mile di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and out of it iſſued forth five or ſix Torrents of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous Waters of different colours. Theſe new Accidents have put the trembling Inhabitants of <hi>Sicily</hi> into freſh Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of ſome impending miſchief ready again to overwhelm them.</p>
            <p n="70">LXX. I ſhall conclude theſe Relations with ſome natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of an ingenous Author. <q>Theſe two or three years paſt (ſaith he) have been general for Earthquakes they have been felt all over Europe, as well as in <hi>America.</hi> Some have been of opinion that the Earth was a great Animal, and that the ſhivering of ſome Ague Fit was the Cauſe of his trembling. The greateſt part of the Heathen Philoſophers accuſed the Stars of theſe diſorders. But to ſpeak one word of the Cauſes of them, I ſay there are two which are Natural, the ſubte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal Fires and Winds are the firſt cauſe. The Bowels of the Earth are full of Mines of Coal, Sulphur and Salt Petre, and when it happens that one Stone falling upon another ſtrikes Fire by Colliſion, thoſe combuſtible matters being kindled, and the Winds blowing up the flame, they cauſe moſt terrible overturnings of the Earth, unleſs they find Outlets as in <hi>Aetna, Veſuvius,</hi> and other Mountains of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The ſecond natural cauſe proceeds from the Water that is under the Earth, which undermining the Foundations that ſupport the ſubterraneal Vaults which extend themſelves for ſeveral Leagues together in divers parts, theſe Vaults depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their uſual ſupport overpreſſed by their own weight, ſink
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:108503:86"/>down, and all of a ſudden impetuouſly puſhing forward the Air and the Water encloſed in the Earth, give the upper part ſuch violent and hoiſtrous jolts as quickly overturn the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtructures of human Art, which muſt of neceſſity give way to thoſe more than Gygantick Impetuoſities, that rend and ſhatter the more ſolid frame of Nature it ſelf. And of this there is no queſtion to be made, conſidering what ſo many Authors have written of the vaſt Regions that are under the Earth, they ſay, that there is in the Iſland of <hi>Malta</hi> a Hill within the Concavities whereof inhabits a famous Plantation of People that have no other day but what they ſee through the Clefts of the Rocks, this place is called <hi>Gaar Kebir,</hi> or the Great Cavern. In the Territory of <hi>Viterbo</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> there is a large ſubterraneal Burrough called <hi>Meonia,</hi> over which there are Meadows, through which you ſhall ſee the ſmoak of that B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rrough ariſe. But all this is nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what <hi>Martin Martinius</hi> relates in his Chymical Atlas. He reports that there is a Mountain in <hi>China</hi> which is full of great Concavities in ſeveral places, which are as it were bored through, and ſerve as Roads from one Province to another. That there are within this Mountain Lakes, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Fiſh, Meadows and Animals of ſeveral ſorts, and that it would require half a years time to ſurvey and deſcribe all theſe Caverns.</q>

            <p n="71">LXXI. To cloſe all with ſome Moral and Divine Reflections. Who doth not ſtart at the thought of ſuch tremblings of the Earth, as we have already given large accounts of? In what condition can a man be ſafe (ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> ſpeaking of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes) <q>when the World it ſelf is ſhaken, and the only thing that paſſes for fixt and immoveable in the Univerſe, trembles and deceives us? Whither ſhall we fly for ſecurity if where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we are the danger be ſtill under our feet? Upon the cracking of an Houſe every man takes himſelf to flight, and leaves all to ſave his life, but what retreat is there where that which ſhould ſupport fails us, when the ſoundations not only of Cities but even of the World it ſelf opens and wavers, what help or what comfort where fear it ſelf can never carry us off? An Enemy may be kept at a diſtance with a Wall, a Caſtle may put a ſtop to an Army, a Port may protect us from the fury of a Tempeſt. Fire it ſelf doth not follow him that runs away from it, a Vault may defend us againſt Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and we may quit the place in a Peſtilence, there is ſome Remedy in all theſe evils. Or however, no man ever knew a whole Nation deſtroy'd by Lightning. A Plague may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108503:86"/>a Town, but it will not carry it away, there is no Evil of ſuch an extent, ſo inevitable, ſo greedy ſo publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Calamitous as an Earthquake. For it does not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Houſes and ſingle Towns but ruins whole Countreys and Nations either overturning or ſwallowing them up, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as leaving any Footſtep or Mark of what they were. Some People have a greater horror for this Death than any other. <hi>To be taken away alive out of the number of the living.</hi> As if all Mortals by what means ſoever were not to come to the ſame end, death, and it is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded whether I am cruſhed to death by one Stone or by a whole Mountain. Whether I periſh by the fall of an Houſe or fall under the burthen of the whole Earth, whether I be ſwallowed up alone or with a thouſand more for Company. We ſhould therefore arm our ſelves againſt that blow, which can neither be avoided nor foreſeen. It is not the abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe places that we find infeſted with Earthquakes which will ſecure us, for there is no Place can be warrant againſt them. What if the Earth be not moved? It is moveable, for the whole body of it lies under the ſame Law and expoſed to danger, only ſome at one time and ſome at another. As it is in great Cities where all the Houſes are ſubject to ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they do not all fall together. So in the body of the Earth, now this part fails and then that. <hi>Tyre</hi> was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject to Earthquakes. In <hi>Aſia</hi> 12 Cities were ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in one night. <hi>Achaia</hi> and <hi>Maccdonia</hi> have had their turns, and now <hi>Compagnia.</hi> The Fate goes round and ſtrikes at laſt where it hath a great while paſſed by. It falls out: oftner, 'tis true, in ſome places than in others, but no place is totally free and exempt. And it is not only men, but Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Coaſts, nay the ſhores and the very Sea it ſelf that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers under the dominion of Fate. And yet we are ſo vain as to promiſe our ſelves ſome kind of aſſurance in the goods of Fortune never conſidering that the very ground we ſtand upon is unſtable, and it is not the frailty of this or that Place, but the quality of every ſpot of it, for not one inch of it is ſo compacted as not to admit many cauſes of its Reſolution. And though the Earth remain entire, the parts of it may yet be broken.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the three Heathen Philoſophers ſtrove to ſortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt theſe calamities which they judged inevitable, not conſidering them as puniſhments of their ſins and enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties inflicted upon them by Divine Juſtice. Hear now what Chriſtians who are inſtructed in a better School ſay of them.</p>

            <q>
               <p>How aſtoniſhing (ſaith a worthy Perſon of our Nation) are the fearful Effects which Earthquakes have had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in all Ages? as we may find them in Hiſtories and Philoſophical Diſcourſes, where you may read of Rocks torn in pieces, Mountains not caſt down only, but removed; Hills raiſed not out of Valleys only, but out of Seas; Fires breaking out of Waters; Stones and Cinders belched up; Rivers Changed; Seas Diſlodged; Earth opening, Towns Swallowed up, and many other ſuch hideous Events. Of which kind our own Memories can furniſh us with many at home, although theſe colder Climates are more rarely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted with ſuch frightful Accidents.</p>
               <p>And of all the Animadverſions that Divine Juſtice gives men, there is none more horrid or leſs Evitable than this of Earthquakes; For what aſſurance can we hope for here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if the Earth quake under our feet? where can we think to eſcape danger, if the moſt ſolid thing of all the World do ſhake? If that which ſuſtains all other things above us, threaten us with ſinking under our feet? What Sanctuary ſhall we find to defend us from an Evil that doth incompaſs us round? And whither can we withdraw, if the Gulphs which open themſelves ſhut up our paſſages on all ſides? With what horror are Men ſtruck when they hear the Earth groan? When her trembling ſucceeds her complaints, when Houſes are looſned from their Foundations, when the Roofs fall upon their heads Heads, and their Pavement ſinks under their Feet? VVhat hope is there to be had in ſo general a diſorder when fear cannot be fenced by flight? In other Caſes there is ſome outlet whereby to eſcape an Evil. An Enemy is beaten from the Bulwark he had poſſeſs'd himſelf; of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works are oppoſed to the Thundring Cannon; VVinds which raiſe Tempeſt. deliver us from them, and after having a long time toſſed us to and fro, they caſt us on the Shore; Houſes ſerve us for Sanctuaries againſt the injuries of the Air and VVeather; If a Man will reſign his goods to the Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <p>This misfortune is common to all Kingdoms; Since Man became Criminal, all parts of the Earth are become move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and ſtedfaſtneſs muſt be no longer lookt for in the VVorld, ſince Innocency is baniſhed thence by Injuſtice.

            <p n="1">I. The firſt ſhall be the Copy of a Letter ſent from an Abbot in <hi>France</hi> giving a Relation of an Hermit living in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey who ſeems to revive the ancient ſimplicity and innocency of that ſolitary Life to which ſome pious men in former ages confined themſelves thereby to be freed from the noiſe and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the World, and to devote their minds wholly to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. Which being ſo very unlike the lazy Luxurious Lives of the generallity of the preſent Romiſh Monks and Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, may be ſomewhat diverting, after the reading the former melancholy Relations; And I ſhall give it you in the Abbots own words as I ſind them in the Memoirs of the Preſent State of <hi>Europe</hi> for the Month of <hi>May</hi> 1692.</p>
            <pb n="168" facs="tcp:108503:88"/>
            <q>
               <p>Sir, It is now eleven years and an half that the famous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hermit has been received into the Wood of my Abby, but I can aſſure you that at this hour I know him no more than the firſt day I ſaw him. This venerable Old Man has been ſo careful to conceal his Name, Family, Countrey, Age, and all that could make him known, that neither I, nor any of his Brethren, nor, as I fancy, any other Perſon has ever known any thing of him touching his Bitth. Having told him one day that the example of a man of his Quality had mighty Efficacy. He cry'd out immediately, telling me that he was nothing, and that if the rumour went he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he would depart the Province the next day, inſomuch that I never mentioned it to him but once ſince. It is now about a month that the occaſion lay fair for ſo doing. He told me with ſome heat that all that was ſaid of his Birth was Lie and Fiction.</p>
               <p>About ſeven years ago he was grievouſly ſick and forſaken by his Phyſicians. The moſt antient of his Brethren, and whom he moſt cheriſhed conjured him to make himſelf known at leaſt to them, promiſing never to diſcover it till after his death. He refuſed him with a rebuke, telling him that it was above 40 years that he had laboured to conceal himſelf, and that he would make him loſe a work of a ſo many years in one quarter of an hour. The truth is, that in the Province of <hi>Burgundy</hi> where he remained a long while, the report ran that he was the Natural Son of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and as ſoon as he came hither the ſame report was ſcattered here. What gave occaſion to it ſo far as I can judge, is his great preſence and his Majeſtick Ayr, which cauſes him to be beloved and reſpected generally by all People, his noble and eaſy carriage and behaviour, his countenance wherein are obſerved many ſeatures of that of <hi>Henry le Grand,</hi> his quick wit, and gay ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, but more eſpecially that profound ſilence he obſerves, to prevent his being known, for the more he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, the more People ſtrive to know who he is, and the leſs he ſpeaks of himſelf the more he is diſcourſt of. As concerning his Age, it is difficult to know it exactly. When he came hither which was in <hi>June</hi> 1676 he told me he was 70 years old. Since he has ſaid he was about the Age of the Biſhop of <hi>Angiers</hi> who is above ninety. He formerly told me he had ſeen the Moors go out of <hi>Spain</hi> when they were driven thence, and that he was then tall. In fine his Brethren by other circumſtances affirm him to be ninety four years old.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:108503:88"/>
               <p>Now follows what I know of his Life, and which I have learnt from himſelf. That until the Age of 20 years he had been well educated, which was the Cauſe of his great Vigor. That he had born Arms without being wounded. That thinking to retire from the World, he had examined all the different manners of living in the Religious Orders, and that nothing had pleaſed him ſo much as the Hermitick Life, after the manner it ſubſiſted in the time of the firſt Hermits of the Eaſt. That this was that he imbraced. That for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he had gone into <hi>Italy,</hi> and had retired into a Forreſt that belonged to the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> whence he had been dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the frequent viſits of the people of that Countrey. That thence he went into <hi>Germany,</hi> and that to ſee a brave Hermit he willingly went 3 or 400 Leagues. That being ſince retired into the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> he had remained in <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain, Champagne,</hi> in <hi>Lionnois,</hi> in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and laſtly in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou.</hi> And that where ever he had been he had built Hermita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and had aſſembled Companions. I fancy you will not be ſorry that I give you ſuch a particular account of his eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment in this Province, ſince I am a Witneſs of it. This good old man having left the Dioceſs of <hi>Langres,</hi> by reaſon (as his Brethren told me) of the report that was ſpread there, of his being the Son of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France.</hi> He took the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of going to ſettle with one of his Companions in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> upon the Sea ſide. Having fallen down as far as <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi> upon the River <hi>Loire,</hi> he underſtood there was a Forreſt in that Neighbourhood where he might erect a fine Hermitage, This Forreſt is called the Wood of <hi>Broſſuy</hi> belonging to <hi>M. de la Meilleraye.</hi> The next day he went with his Companion to view that Forreſt, but having found no Water in it, he loſt hopes of being able to retire thither. At his coming out of the Wood this good old Man being wearied, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Abbey he came to it to refreſh himſelf. I received him and falling preſently to diſcourſe of ſolitude and retreat, he reaſoned ſo well and ſenſibly of it, that I lookt upon him as a <hi>ſolitary,</hi> filled with the Maxims and Sentiments of one of the Primitive Hermits. In the ſequel of our Converſation he told me the occaſion that had brought him into our Countrey, and that he only ſought a little Water and Wood to make him a Retreat, I offered him a ſmall ſpace of ground planted with Coppice, near a fine Spring and about a mile from our Abbey, he accepted it, but I thought ſit to tell him, by way of precaution, that beſides the place I offered him, he could not expect any great aſſiſtance from me, becauſe our Abbey
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:108503:89"/>was ſmall and ruinous, and my Companions would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain if they ſaw me ingage to build and furniſh an Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage with Requiſits; Further I was in a Countrey where were many poor who would murmur if I rendred my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of relieving them. However we would ſupply Wood and other Materials for building of Cells, and if they could not ſubſiſt with the labour of their hands, we, in their neceſſity would ſhare our bread with them. To this he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered what merits to be known. That he only ſought a little Wood to hide himſelf, and a little Water to build ſome Cell with Earth, That as to his Nouriſhment and Cloths, they were the leaſt of his Concerns, and the ſmalleſt of his Cares, That his Brethren and he, knew how to bring up Bees, which would furniſh them with Cloaths, and the labour of their hands would give them bread ſufficient. That they knew how to make Panniers, of which the deareſt ſold were ſuch as they gave for nothing, That they were Carpenters, Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers, and that they had nor need of any Workman, no not ſo much as to make their Cloaths. That they would not be a burden to any body. That they would not beg, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing of any whoever.</p>
               <p>All this proved exactly true, They have a great number of Bees, They make a great number of Panniers, Baskets and other Oſier works which they give away, without having ever ſold any for a Penny. They want neither Cloths, nor any of the things neceſſary for Life; They are a charge to none, nor ever ask any thing, nay are loth to receive what is offered them. They have built nine or ten Cells and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pretty Chappel. They have them ſelves grub'd up a part of their Wood to make a Garden and Orchards, and to plant Oſiers. This Hermitage is fine and the admiration of all People. And ſince you would know after what manner they Live therein, I muſt tell you, That they riſe very early; That they begin the day with Meditation and Prayer, That then they go to Prayers in the Chappel, for they have a Prieſt among them; After they go to work till ten a Clock, then they aſſemble to hear the reading of ſome good Book, and then they dine. After Dinner they go to work till five a Clock, Then they go into their Chappel, perform half an hours Meditation, and ſay ſome Prayers and from thence they go to the Refectory to take their repaſt, after which they go again to work upon their Oſiers till ten at night; During which one of them in their turns reads ſome good Book, or the good Father gives them inſtruction; Their drink is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:108503:89"/>wherein they put Juniper-Berries; this they call Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vrette; Their uſual meat are Pulſe, Legumes and Fruits, and what providence ſends them, for they never buy either Fleſh or Fiſh; Their Cells are ſmall and very low, their moveables conſiſt in a Straw Bed, a little Table, and the Repreſentation of Chriſt on the Croſs, ſome Paper Picture, and ſome devout Books. They are Cloathed in White, wear no Linnen, have no Shoes but Wooden Sandals and go bare Leg'd; They Live under che obedience of the Biſhop of <hi>Angiers,</hi> who loves them tenderly; They make no Vows but they practice them exactly; They never Beg; They keep no Box; They give a great deal of Alms, and the poor are never ſeen to go from their Hermitage empty handed; The Father has a very tender Heart, eſpecially toward poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, whom he gladly aſſiſts; They ſeldom ſtir abroad unleſs it be to the Pariſh-Church on <hi>Sundays</hi> and great Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, and never eat in the Neighbourhood; The Father is neither a Prieſt nor Clerk, but a Perſon of great reading, eſpecially in Hiſtory. This is what I know concerning this Old Man, but his Birth is altogether unknown to me; I know People pretend to find additional marks and Conjectures ſufficiently ſtrong to eſtabliſh the report that goes about it; but as theſe are only Hearſays. and not built upon any thing he himſelf has ſaid, little credit is to be afforded to them.</p>

            <p n="2">II. The ſecond ſtrange Occurrence or Accident I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Abſtract of another Letter inſerted in the <hi>Memoirs of the Preſent State of Europe,</hi> for the Month of <hi>November,</hi> 1693. written from <hi>Breſlaw</hi> a City in <hi>Sileſia</hi> one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the <hi>German</hi> Empire, and Dated <hi>Sep.</hi> 7. 1693.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Sir juſt as I was cloſing this Letter, there came to me a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and told me that the Locuſts which are like Graſhoppers, appeared in the Air, I went out of the City with a vaſt crowd of People the better to ſee this great Prodigy; 'Tis an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible thing, and if I had not been an Eye witneſs of it my ſelf I ſhould hardly have believed it. They flew in the Air about a mans height diſtant from the ground, and reacht up above the higheſt Steeple, making a noiſe like a violent wind; and were as thick together as the Snow commonly falls; They paſt the <hi>Oder,</hi> and then Directed their courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and they continue this March to the very Inſtant I am writing, which is about five Clock in the Evening. It is a frightful ſight; Theſe Locuſts or Graſhoppers are the length of ones Finger' and of Green, Brown and Yellow Colours. Letters from <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:108503:90"/>ſpoke of them a fortnight ago, but no Body gave cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to them; At night they reſt and extend themſelves at leaſt 16. Engliſh Miles in circumference; They eat up every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Herbs, Graſs, Leaves and whatever is Green, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Barks of Trees; They march every day about 12. or 16. Miles; Yeſternight they took up their Quarters ſome two Leagues from hence, and this night perhaps may lodge in the adjacent Parts, or in the Meadow grounds there about. The Contrey People run in great Companies to the places where they think they will light, and with the noiſe of Drums and Shooting off Guns, fright them a little farther. They write from all parts that theſe Creatures are not only vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous but they even leave an Infection upon the Graſs and every thing they touch; In a Village not far from this Town 'tis ſaid, that 200. Swine were poyſoned with them. The thing is amazing but yet true; One can hardly believe that it were poſſible there ſhould be ſo many of theſe Inſects in the World; for they are three hours in paſſing by, and extend themſelves three or four Leagues in Length. Some will tell you that they obſerved upon their Wings the number of the year, 1693. and certain Hebrew Characters; but I muſt confeſs that I could diſcover no ſuch things, otherwiſe I ſhould have preſerved ſome of theſe Wings.</p>

               <p>The Graſhoppers I mentioned in my laſt, remain yet within four Leagues or ſixteen Engliſh Miles of this place, and the wether having been a little cold, all the ground round about is covered over with them a foot thick; ſome contagious Diſeaſe may proably be the conſequence. The next day which was the Eight Inſtant the March of theſe Creatures yet continued near this City till two a Clock, and in the Morning at Sun-Riſing abundance more were obſerved to paſs by; ſome whereof being weary dropt down in our Streets.</p>

            <p>Theſe two Letters were written by a Perſon of Note. whoſe Name there is no occaſion to tell, but being a Man of Integrity, and writing nothing but what he ſaw, it would be ſome what ſtrange not to give credit to his Teſtimony.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Third and Laſt remarkable Inſtance I ſhall give is, An Account of Three Wonderful and Miraculous Cures lately wrought by the Power of God, and the Divine Efficacy of a ſincere Faith in his Bleſſed Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt is the remarkable cure of <hi>Mary Maillard,</hi> a French Girl, of Thirteen Years of Age, living at St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:108503:90"/>(of which a Relation of undoubted Truth and Veracity, with a multitude of undeniable Atteſtations is lately publiſhed.) This Young Maid was very Lame from her Birth, and as ſhe grew in Years appeared ſtill more deformed in her going, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a diflocation in her left Thigh, ſo that in walking, by throwing her Body firſt on one ſide, and then on the other; ſhe became ridiculous to the Children in the Streets, who often abuſed her with ill Names, and threw Dirt at her, to ſhew how hateful ſhe was in their ſight. This ill Treatment much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted her, particularly upon <hi>Sunday Novemb.</hi> 26. 1693. when coming from Church ſhe met with her former Young Perſecutors, who ſlockt about her, and beſpattered her Cloaths with Dirt; upon her coming home ſhe grieved and wept extreamly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to her Miſtreſs of the Abuſes offered her, who exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to be patient, and put her Truſt in God. In the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening ſhe took the Bible, and in reading the ſecond Chapter of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> wherein is related the Miraculous Cure of one ſick of the Palſey; ſhe ſeemed very much affected therewith, and told her Miſtreſs that ſhe could not but wonder at the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of the <hi>Jews,</hi> adding, That if ſuch a thing ſhould happen now, ſhe would ſoon run and be Cured too; ſhe had no ſooner ſpoke but her great Pains which ſhe formerly ſelt began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with more violence, and ſuddenly ſtretching out her Leg, the Bone ſnapt into its place, and her Foot and Knee were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reſtored to their natural poſture; Upon which her Pains immediately went off, and ſhe ſuppoſed a Voice ſaid to her, <hi>Thou art healed;</hi> and ſhe was fully Cured of her Lameneſs walking up and down the Chamber, and ſo ſhe ſtill continues, telling all that come to ſee, of which there are great numbers daily, that ſhe was Lame, but thanks be to God ſhe is not now ſo, and that ſhe was recovered by Reading a Chapter in the Goſpel without any Humane Help.</p>
            <p>This Remarkable Inſtance of Almighty Power and Goodneſs has been ſince followed with Two other of the like Nature, of which I ſhall now give ſuch a brief and true Relation, with the Names of the Places and Parties concerned therein, as will leave no room for the ſevereſt Critick to queſtion the Certainty thereof.</p>
            <p>One is the Admirable Cure of Mrs. <hi>Savage,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Mr. Savage,</hi> a Miniſter, and Schoolmaſter living in <hi>Horſ ſhoe-Alley</hi> in <hi>Morefields.</hi> This Gentlewoman had a very troubleſom Lameneſs in her Hand from a Child, her Fingers being ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, that her Hand ſeemed almoſt wholly ſaut, inſomuch that it was of little uſe to hee.</p>
            <pb n="174" facs="tcp:108503:91"/>
            <p>In <hi>December</hi> laſt 1693. ſhe had likewiſe ſome Weakneſs and Illneſs of Body, and about the latter end of the ſame Month, ſome Means being adminiſtred unto her for the ſame, her Husband thought it neceſſary to implore the Bleſſing of God thereupon, by Faſting and Prayer, and accordingly went to Prayer with her; before he had done, ſhe found a real A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of her Diſtemper as ſhe declared afterward, and that ſhe was much better than ſhe had been a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: After the Duty was ended, as they were ſitting by the Fire, the Story of the <hi>French</hi> Girl aforementioned came into his mind, of which he had heard by two Perſons, yet could not give full Credit to the Truth thereof, but uſed ſome ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Bleſſing God if it were true: At length a ſtrong Impreſſion came upon his Spirit, that his Wifes Hand might be Cured by the ſame Means that the Girl's was (if it were true;) And thereupon he took the Bible to look out the ſame Chapter, by the Reading whereof (it was ſaid) ſhe was Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but not being exactly informed which it was, they fell upon the 8th Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and Reading there of the Faith of the Leper, who ſaid, <hi>Lord, if theu wilt thou canſt make make me clean.</hi> He with an Extraordinary Emotion of Spirit took hold of his Wifes Hand, and asked her if ſhe had Faith to believe that her hand could be Cured; adding, that his Faith was as much as the Lepers; for though he did abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely believe the Power of Chriſt, yet he put an <hi>If</hi> to the Will of Chriſt, or words to that effect: To which ſhe replied, That ſhe had Faith in the Power of Chriſt, that he was as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble now he is in Heaven, to Cure her, as he was when upon Earth, but whether it was his pleaſure, or whither he ſaw it good for her, ſhe could not tell; but if he thought fit, ſhe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not but he would Heal her, or to that pupoſe: Her Husband proceeded in Reading till he came to the Faith of the <hi>Centurion</hi> about his Servant, when on a ſudden ſhe felt a pain in her Knuckles and Fingers, and pulling off her Glove, her Hand inſtantly ſtretched out ſtraight, and became like the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhe was immediately Cured of what was judged by all to be incurable. Her Hand likewiſe received ſtrength as well as ſtraightneſs; and whereas it uſed to be extreamly cold it is now as warm as the other: The Gentlewoman has alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch ſtrength of Body, that whereas formerly ſhe was ſcarce able to walk half a Mile, ſhe can now go three or four Mile: She ſtill continues in Health, both her ſelf and Husband bleſſing and Praiſing God for his wonderful and miraculous
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:108503:91"/>Mercy and Goodneſs towards them. The Truth hereof will be confirmed by themſelves, to any who inquire at their Houſe aforementioned as well as by divers others.</p>
            <p>The laſt Relation is as certain as the two former, of which I ſhall likewiſe give the Names of the Perſons, and their Places of aboad, as it came in a Letter from <hi>Hitchin</hi> in <hi>Hartferdſhire,</hi> as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hitchin, Jan.</hi> 6. 1693. Dear Sir, Yours I received the laſt Night; As to the Perſon you enquire after, and the Lord's work upon him, take it in ſhort as followeth: His Name is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Wright,</hi> about 27 or 28 Years of Age; he lived two or three Miles from hence for ſome Years, in the capacity of a Shepherd, his Diſtemper of Body by the <hi>Evil</hi> rendring him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any hard Work: At <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1693. he deſired a Religious Woman to take him into her Service, which ſhe was unwilling to do, becauſe he was a prophane Wretch, and much given to Swearing and other Vices, but upon his promiſing a Reformation, and that he would go to Hear the Word Preach'd, ſhe Hired him; yet he afterward went on in his Evil Courſes, and would not go to Hear: But <hi>Nov.</hi> 29. laſt paſt, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that there was a Sermon to be Preach'd at <hi>Hitchin,</hi> by one Mr. <hi>Edward Coles,</hi> a worthy Miniſter, his Mind was ſo much ſixt to go and Hear him, that notwithſtanding the ſame day he had a Brother came for him with a Horſe to go ſome Miles ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way about urgent Buſineſs of his own, yet he could by no means be prevailed with to go with him, of which Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſays he can give no reaſon in himſelf: He came to Hear, and the Word made ſuch deep Impreſſion upon his Mind, that his Soul was Converted, and his Body Healed at the ſame time: He declares that while the Miniſter was Preaching his hard Heart was ſoftened, and the Eyes of his Mind inlightened, whereby he had Faith in his Bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and that at the ſame time he found his Body Cured of the <hi>Evil</hi> under which he had long Languiſhed, and is fully perſwaded he ſhall never have it again: But however God may pleaſe to do as to that, this is certain, that he hath been very well from the 29th of <hi>November</hi> to this very day: But the Change upon his Soul is more remarkable than the Cure of his Body; To ſee ſuch a poor groſly ignorant Wretch ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly Changed, and to hear him bleſſing and praiſing of God, and admiring his Grace and Love to him, That he who knew nothing one hour before, ſhould now ſpeak ſo ſenſibly of Jeſus Chriſt and heavenly things; This is to the aſtoniſhment and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of all that knew him: As to his bodily Diſtemper,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:108503:92"/>he has had the <hi>King's Evil</hi> for about ſteen or ſiſtxteen Years paſt, and was formerly Touched by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second: At firſt he was forced to keep his Bed for ſeveral Weeks together, great Pains and divers running Sores upon him; but for about twelve Years paſt he has been in Service for the moſt part, yet never in Health all the while, but had Running Sores which were ſometimes skinn'd over and ſwell'd, and then he was at the worſt, and felt moſt Pain till they broke and run again: He has had theſe Sores in many parts of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of which the Scars are viſible, and two continued in the ſame place in the ſmall of his Back a long while, and at the time when he came to Hear the Sermon aforementioned they were skinn'd over, and ſwell'd, ſo that he was in very great Pain, and could not keep pace with his Company; but while he was Hearing, the ſwelling of his Sores ſunk inſenſibly, and he was well on a ſudden, and all his Pain was gone; ſo that as they returned home, he went before them leaping, rejoycing, and praiſing God for his great Mercy and Loving kindneſs to him all the way he went. After he came home he continued to admire the exceeding Grace of God to ſo vile and ignorant a Sinner as he was, and ſpent moſt part of the Night in this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Exerciſe, and ſtill remains in this admirable frame of Heart. Much more might be mentioned, but this may ſuffice at preſent from <hi>Yours,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>We whoſe Names are hereunto ſubſcribed, do hereby atteſt and declare.

            <p>In ſhort, as Atheiſm and Prophaneneſs, it may be, never more abounded than in the preſent Age; ſo the Almighty hath not leſt himſelf without witneſs of his Power and Providence in the World, by ſeveral Examples both of Judgment and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; And a Race of Impious Wretches being riſen up, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Divinity of our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour; <hi>The Almighty by theſe repeated Inſtances of Supernatural Power ſeems at this time loudly to aſſert and proclaim the Godhead of our Glorious Redeemer, ſince ſuch Miracles are new wrought by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, as very much reſemble thoſe done by himſelf when he was in the State of Humanity.</hi>
